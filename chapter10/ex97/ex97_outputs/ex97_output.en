Umekoji Steam ⁇  Museum is a facility for the preservation of steam locomotives managed by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) in Kankiji-cho, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.
On October 10, 1972, the Japan National Railways ( ⁇ ) opened the first facility to use the fan-shaped ⁇  in Umekoji-ku, Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the opening of Japan's railway, and the steam locomotive that had been supported by Japanese railway was positioned as a valuable industrial cultural property and its ⁇ .
JR West succeeded to JR West due to the division and privatization of JNR in 1987.
In addition, this facility itself is an active car ⁇  base (Umekoji Operation section), and tests and tests of JNR DE10 diesel locomotives owned by JNR and the Sagano Scenic Railway are also conducted.
In the first place, the ⁇  of steam locomotives rapidly disappeared in the latter half of the 1960s.
Initially, the ⁇  district, which was located in Oyama Station, Tochigi Prefecture, was the most likely candidate for the ⁇  district, but when it was located in 'the central part of Japan,' the Umekoji District (at that time) was officially selected as a Preservation District for ⁇  of Historic Buildings in 1970.
As a general rule, the existing cars for preservation were ⁇  to select the latest cars (or the first train), but there were also cars that weren't planned to be preserved at first, such as the C62-type No.2. 2 cars.
The facility consists of the "Red steam locomotive Exhibition Hall" which used the fan-shaped storage room in the former Umekoji Engine Depot and the "Returning Exhibition Hall" in which the former Nijo Station building was moved and reconstructed.
The fan-shaped ⁇  was made of reinforced concrete that was built in 1914, and it was designated as one of the national important cultural properties along with the five-t ⁇ ed planes on December 10, 2004 (completed in 1915).
In the same year, 2004, it was selected as a civil engineering heritage by the Ministry of Civil Engineering.
In 2006, the former Nijo Station building ( ⁇  Exhibition Hall), the Ogi-type train depot, the one- ⁇  steam locomotives, and the one- ⁇ ing tools for repairing the railways were designated as the semi- ⁇  railway ⁇  by JR West.
The former Nijo station building, which was built in 1904 by Kyoto Electric Railway at the same time as the main building, was the oldest Japanese-style house built in Japan, and was built in the Heian-jingu Shrine in consideration of the landscape.
Kyoto Electric Railway was ⁇  in 1907 and then used as a facility for the JR Kobe Line, but the work ended in 1996 when the station was elevated between Nijo Station ( ⁇  Line) and Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) on the Sanin Main Line ( ⁇  Line), and in 1997, the station was moved and reconstructed in the premises of the main building and reconstructed in 1997, and the inside of the building has been used as a shop for selling old products.
It was designated as a cultural property by Kyoto City in April 1996.
In the ⁇ , 18 domestic steam locomotives manufactured from the Taisho period to the Showa period (at the beginning of the opening time, 16 types of steam locomotives) are housed and exhibited.
When the museum was opened, the C535-type train car and C51-type 9-type train-cars were registered in the Ministry of Health, Labor and Labor No. 2-type train-cars, but later the number of cars for the preservation of the cars was changed several times as of 2006, and as of 2006, seven-car bodies are being preserved.
Among them, five-car trains are still registered on the main line, and two-car trains (C57 type and C56 type ⁇ ) are used on the Yamaguchi Line as 'Yamaguchi (train)' and 'Kita- ⁇  (train)' on the Hokuriku Main Line.
The ⁇ s other than these two cars can't run on the main line because of the lack of all inspections.
In addition, the JNR/JR Limited Express 'SL ⁇ -go,' which is air- ⁇ ing machines for display in the museum, are operated on the railway inside the building.
Although this exhibition operation line was once extended from the depot to the north to the northern end of the site of a large-size car parking lot (at that time there used to be a park) (where there used to be a park), it was changed to a new one in which the current Umekoji-koen (Umekoji Park) was moved to the former Umekoji-koen Station.
Even now, the station functions as an institution and is connected to the commercial line.
In addition, after the Takatori factory of West Japan Railway Company closed, they also maintained the maintenance of steam locomotives.
Japanese▁plum
It originates from 'Ume' which means Umekoji.
All cars except the C62-type cars, which were designated in 1976, were designated as semi- ⁇  railway ⁇  together with conservative ⁇ s in▁2006.
In 1972, the above-mentioned procedures were taken from the former organizations to be transferred from the above-mentioned organizations.
There is no car registration from the beginning of the preservation of Umekoji.

Shomyo is one of the traditional Japanese music.
It is a religious music that is used for rites and festivals.
In Japan, it is also called Bonbai or Bonku.
It is written as  ⁇  in old Japanese syllabary characters.
It is one of the academic fields (gomyo, gomyo) of Myobodo (study of Codes).
Gomyo refers to five kinds of learning: Shomyo (the study of psychics and ⁇ s), Kokkomei (the theory of arts and techniques), Ihomei (the study of medicine), Inmei (the study of ethics), and Naimyo (the study of Buddhism in the case of Buddhists).
It was introduced to Japan along with the introduction of Buddhism to Japan.
There is a record that a Buddhist memorial service with Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) was held at the time of the ceremony to ⁇  the Great Buddha of Todai-ji Temple in ⁇ , and it is believed that Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) was actively performed in the Nara period.
In the early Heian period, Saicho and Kukai transmitted Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s), and they became the basis of Tendai Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) and Shingon Shomyo (chanting of Shingon).
The sects other than the Tendai sect and the Shingon sect have their own shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) and they are still inherited to the present day.
Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) was written in kuden (oral instruction), so there was no endangered word.
Therefore, ⁇  was extremely difficult.
Later, a doctor who served as tenmon hakase (master of astronomy) was invented.
Also, each school has specialized terms such as hakase (professor) and so on.
However, hakase is a reference to chanting Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s), and in order to learn Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s), kuden (or roi) (or menju) (or menju) is needed, so it is impossible to maintain and inherit the school from a teacher to a disciple.
Therefore, training of leaders and successors was essential.
Many schools were abolished due to various conditions.
Tendai Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) was based on Saicho's instruction and developed independently.
After Saicho, Ennin and Annen flourished.
 ⁇ , the founder of ⁇ -ji Temple, is known as the Chuko no So (father of restoration).
In ⁇ , ⁇  built ⁇ -in Temple ( ⁇  Ward, Kyoto City) in Ohara, Kyoto.
The sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple) of ⁇ -in Temple in Ohara, was modeled after Mt. Gyozan, a Chinese Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) and Mt. Gyozan.
Before long, two temples of ⁇ -in Temple and Shorin-in Temple came to be known as the training halls of Ohara-ryu Uozan Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant).
In addition, Jakugen later formed a new school, and in Ohara there were two lines of Shomyo.
Later, ⁇  revived Ohara Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant).
Tanchi developed the trend based on a new musical theory.
After that, it became the center of Tendai Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) and was inherited by the present Tendai Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant).
Shomyo of the Yuzu Nenbutsu sect, the Jodo sect and the Jodo Shinshu sect are the lineage of Tendai Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant).
The Tachikawa-ryu school originated from the fact that the Shingon Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) was introduced by Kukai.
It was after the era of ⁇  when Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) was systemized.
Kancho was especially regarded as the Chuko no So (father of restoration).
He strived to compose and improve Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s).
There were many schools until the Kamakura period, but four were established by Cloistered Imperial Prince Kakusho (Honpoin-ryu, Shinso-in-ryu, Daigo-ryu, and Nakagawa-Oshin-ryu).
The Shomyo of the Kogi Shingon sect declined and disappeared from the Edo period.
Honsoin-ryu, ⁇ -in-ryu and Daigo-ryu were abolished in the middle of the Meiji period.
At present, it is separated into Chizan Shomyo ( ⁇ -ji Temple in Kyoto), Buzan Shomyo ( ⁇ -dera Temple in Nara), Nanzan Shinryu (Mt. Koya, Mt. Koya, Kyoto and Kogi Shingon sect.
Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s), Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s), Shingon sect Chisan school and Shingon sect ⁇  school were originally derived from the Nakagawa Oshin school.
 ⁇  adopted the old school of Daigo.
In 1583, when Sakamoto-jo Castle ( ⁇  Prefecture) was burned down by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI, the foundation of Mt. Chisan and Mt. Toyoyama came to form a new school based on the old school of Daigo.
It is characterized by 'rongi' ( ⁇ s) and 'shomyo' (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) of Mt. ⁇ .
Nanshin school (Kogi Shingon sect line) was founded by ⁇  NAKAGAWA.
The Nakagawa Oshin school was founded by Daishin of Nakagawa-ji Temple in Nara.
During the Teiei era (1232 - ⁇ ), ⁇  of Mt. Koya Renge-dani and Sanbo-in moved his base to Mt. Koya.
Later, it was renamed Nanzan Shinryu after adding its other name to Mt. Koya.
He was the founder of the Noyamashin-ryu school.
The music of Heikyoku, Yokyoku (Noh song), Joruri ( ⁇  narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment), and Joruri ( ⁇  narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment) is a turning point of Shomyo.
It is largely influenced by ⁇  music.
Emperor Tenchi (also known as Emperor Tenchi)
He was a male.
626 - January 7,▁672
He was the 38th Emperor.
His ⁇  (a posthumous name) is Amanomihirakasuwake no mikoto (also written as 天 ⁇ 命 or 天津別命).
His imina (personal name) was Kazuragi (or Katsuragi).
It is believed that he was called Katsuragi no Miko (or Katsuragi no Miko) while he was alive.
He is generally known as Naka no Oe no Oji (also known as Naka no Oe no Oji).
Oe' means Crown Prince, and 'Naka no Oe' means 'the next Crown Prince.'
▁Summary
He was the second Prince of Emperor Jomei.
His mother was Takara no Himemiko (later Empress Kogyoku).
The Empress was her older paternal half-brother, ⁇  no Oe no Miko's daughter, ⁇  no Okimi.
He conspired with NAKATOMI no Kamatari and rose in revolt with his uncle, Emperor Kotoku, and he himself became the Crown Prince.
And he enacted the Taika Reforms and carried out various reforms (the Taika Reforms, the Isshi no hen [the ⁇  in the Year of Isshi]).
He was also sentenced to death by ⁇  a coup d'état in later years, such as the ⁇  Coup.
Since Baekje was destroyed by the Tang Dynasty and Silla (ancient Korean kingdom) in ⁇ , he sent King Baekje FUYO ⁇  to restore Baekje.
He stayed in Chikushi to command Baekje's rescue, but he passed away in 661.
After that, he didn't succeed to the throne for a long time, but after the Kusuko Incident in ⁇ , he moved the capital to Otsu City and was enthroned there.
After the Battle of Shiramura, as part of the national defense policy, mizu-shiro (castles on lakes or ⁇ es for defensive reasons), hike (castles on lakes or ⁇ es for defensive reasons) and sakimori (guards) were set up.
Also, he was promoted from the 19th rank to the 26th rank system, and so on.
In 670, he made ' ⁇  no Nenjaku,' the oldest national family register in Japan.
According to Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan), Emperor Tenchi ordered Prince Otomo, the first prince, to succeed to the throne.
However, in the Jinshin War, which occurred after the death of Emperor Tenchi, his younger brother Prince Oama (Emperor Tenmu) supported Prince Otomo and enthroned.
Since then, Emperors in the line of Emperor Tenmu are called Empress Shotoku.
After the death of Emperor Shotoku, Prince ⁇ , a grandson of Emperor Tenchi, ascended the throne as Emperor Konin, and after that, the lineage of Emperor Tenchi became the line of Emperor Tenchi.
Since Prince Oama gave birth to Nukata no Okimi, it is said that he sent his four daughters to Prince Oama as his wife.
Brief Personal▁History
626 - Born.
The Crown Prince was formally installed as Crown Prince on July 12, ⁇ .
Seimyo July 24, 661 (August 24, 661) -▁Shosei
On February 20, 668, he succeeded to the throne.
On January 7, 672, he died at the age of 46.
(In the "Shinsen ⁇ " (Newly ⁇  Register of Clan Names and Titles of ⁇ ), there is a view that after the death of the Emperor, there is a description that 'there is a theory that the Emperor was killed in the mountains where the Imperial mausoleum was located, and there was a theory that the Emperor Tenmu side killed him in the mountains.')
It is one of the ⁇ s in the political history of the seventh century that Emperor Tenchi did not ascend to the throne for a long time.
There are several theories as to the above.
In consideration of the Emperor Tenmu's ⁇  power.
In other words, it is wrong that Emperor Tenmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi, and it is based on a theory that he was an older paternal half-brother of Emperor Tenchi, who was born before Empress Kogyoku married Emperor Jomei.
It is certain that Emperor Tenmu was older than Emperor Tenchi in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) and according to some history books, the year of his birth was ⁇  based on the age of Emperor Tenmu.
However, there are no contradictions between the same historical materials, and there are many historical materials about the age of eight to nine.
On the other hand, according to "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), the age of Emperor Tenchi was 16 years old when his father Emperor Jomei ascended to the throne when his father, Emperor Jomei, was enthroned and passed away, because it was ⁇  that 'my father had a different father's younger brother.'
Therefore, "Honcho koin jounroku" (the Emperor's family tree, made in the Muromachi period) and so on were adopted in 614.
The Emperor Tenchi and Jito, who were in power at the time of the Emperor Tenmu's reign, did not ascend to the throne immediately because they were not rare in ancient times.
(In other words, there was a mis ⁇  difference.)
There is an opposing argument with "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) or other history books which are pointed out as 'Nihonshoki' (Chronicles of Japan) also differ from time to time, so some people say that they are not treated in the same way.
(See also the section on 'the age of Emperor Tenmu.')
Prince Arima was a coup d' ⁇  by Prince Karu (Emperor Kotoku), and Prince Naka no Oe was driven out of his position.
Recently, it has been pointed out that the relationship between Naka no Oe no Oji and ⁇  no Oe no Oji is relatively good and the basic policy is similar.
That is why Naka no Oe no Oji killed Iruka.
Since the description of Taika no ⁇  (Great Reformation of the Taika Era) in Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan) can be found, this theory has been advocated.
This view attracts attention as to the reason why the abdication of the throne of Emperor Kogyoku and the reason why the Soga clan other than Iruka were not expelled even after the coup.
There is a theory that the enthronement was ⁇  due to the ⁇  against the female relationship of the Emperor Tenchi.
This is because there is a poem in which Emperor Kotoku described in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) about his wife's imperial princess (Emperor Tenchi's older maternal half-sister).
Although his love and marriage between ⁇  and sisters were allowed, there were some scenes such as the scene where he was furious about the fact that he was actually involved in the Tenjo no ma ( ⁇  of the Heavenly ⁇ ) written by his uncle, ⁇  NAKAMA (Emperor Kotoku), and that he had a relationship even after the demise of his uncle, Karu no Okimi (Emperor Kotoku).
After the death of Empress Saimei, ⁇  no himemiko succeeded to the throne as the wife of the previous emperor, but there is a theory that the record was ⁇  due to some reasons.
According to "Manyoshu" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves), 'Naka no Mikoto' comes from the theory that the person who is called 'Naka no Mikoto' comes from the theory of ⁇  no Himemiko, and 'Naka no Mikoto' can be interpreted as the Emperor during the period until the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi.
If ⁇  no Himemiko is called 'Nakami no Mikoto,' there is a theory that she was called only such a special title, but there is also a theory that she was Empress Saimei, which does not necessarily mean that she was the Empress Saimei.
Because of the nature of politics and the ⁇  of historical materials, it is difficult to prove, but the progress of research has been made in the future, including cooperation with the results of ⁇ .
▁Song
He was also a poet whose four poems were selected for "Manyoshu" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).
In Ogura Hyakunin Isshu (the Ogura Anthology of One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Poets), KAKI ⁇  no Hitomaro as the ⁇  of the Heian Dynasty contains the following poems at the beginning.
The rice field of autumn leaves in the field of autumn is ⁇ , but my clothes are not exposed.
The following poems are also included in Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).
In Mt. ⁇ , there was a conflict between the ⁇ s and the ⁇ s and the ⁇ s of the gods, and the ⁇ s of the ancient times were so fierce that there was no end to the ancient times.
The Saionji family was a kuge (court noble) descended from the Fujiwara clan.
He was a descendant of the Fujiwara clan and his family status was the Seiga family (one of the highest court noble families in Japan at that time).
The ⁇  family and the Imadegawa family (Kikutei family) were branch families of the Saionji family.
In addition, the Saionji clan, a samurai family in Iyo Province, was one of the influential branch families who used the surname Saionji.
The family crest was a three-sided  ⁇  pattern.
The Saionji family was founded by FUJIWARA no Michisue, the third son of FUJIWARA no ⁇ .
During the Jokyu War when Michisue's great-grandson, MINAMOTO no Yoritomo, was backed up by the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) as a leader of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), he was confined in the Imperial Court; however, after the war, he gained the confidence of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) and held the real power of the Imperial Court as a ⁇  ( ⁇  of the High Court) and rose to the position of Daijo-daijin (Grand Minister).
Saionji's family name is derived from the name of ⁇ -ji Temple in Kyoto ( ⁇ so, Kadono-gun, Yamashiro Province).
This hall is also known as Kitayamadono, and the current Kinkaku-ji Temple was built by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA, who was given this land by the Saionji family.
He gained support from the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) since Kintsune, and had power over Sekke (line of regents and advisers) through the Kamakura period.
 ⁇  SAIONJI succeeded the Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama) and had his daughter marry the Cloistered Emperor Kameyama and Emperor Godaigo.
After the death of his son, Kinhira SAIONJI, the Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama) distanced from the bakufu, however, the Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama) sided with the Jimyoin-to (imperial lineage from Emperor Gofukakusa to Emperor Gokomatsu) and deepened confrontation with the Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage from Emperor Gofukakusa to Emperor Gokomatsu).
Afterwards, during the reign of Kinmune SAIONJI, the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) fell, and he was appointed to the post of ⁇  (a person representing the master during his absence).
Kinmune harbored ⁇  HOJO (Tokioki), who was the remnants of the Hojo clan, and assassinated Emperor Godaigo, who started the Kenmu Restoration, and plotted a rebellion against the Retired Emperor Gofushimi after the Jimyoin-to (imperial lineage from Emperor Gofukakusa to Emperor Gokomatsu), and his younger brother Kinshige SAIONJI was arrested and executed.
During the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, Kinmune SAIONJI, a son of Kinmune, served the Northern Court and became Udaijin (Minister of the Right) and restored the family name.
In the Muromachi and Edo periods, the family specialized in biwa (Japanese lute) as its family business.
In the early Edo period, ⁇  SAIONJI married Tadataka HOSOKAWA, the legitimate son of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA (later disinherited), and Tokuhime, the first daughter of Kyumu ⁇ , to Sadaijin (Minister of the Left), but Kyumu ⁇  made a fund for financial affairs in the Saionji family and gave him 600 koku (according to Kinko ⁇ roku).
At the end of the Edo period, Kinmochi SAIONJI was adopted from Rikken ⁇  (a political party organized by Hirobumi ITO) who was also a member of the Rikken ⁇  (a political party organized by Hirobumi ITO), and after the Meiji Restoration, he played an active role as a politician, serving as a prime minister, and played an important role in the politics of the Taisho and Showa periods.
Incidentally, there is an episode that Kinmochi was suffering from a biwa (Japanese lute) playing the Saionji family's family business, but during his tenure as Prime Minister, he was told by Emperor Meiji that 'I want to listen to the biwa (Japanese lute) of the Saionji family for a long time,' and he was forced to ⁇  the staff and biwa (Japanese lute) of the Imperial Household Ministry's Gagakuryo (Bureau of Music).

"Makura no Soshi" (The Pillow Book) is an essay which is said to have been written by Sei Shonagon, a female writer in the mid-Heian period.
It is also written as 'Makura no Soshi' (Makura no Soshi (The Pillow Book), 'Makura no soshi' (The Pillow Book), 'Makura no soshi' (The Pillow Book), and ' ⁇  sho' (The Pillow Book) in the oldest manuscript in the Kamakura period, and 'Sei Shonagon Makura no Soshi' (The Pillow Book).
It was also called "Sei Shonagon ki" (Diary of Sei Shonagon).
As a pair of literary works associated with "Genji Monogatari" (The Tale of Genji), renga (linked verses), haikai ( ⁇ -syllable verse) and kana zoshi (story book written in kana (the Japanese syllabaries)) were written in later ages.
Along with "Hojoki" (An ⁇  of My Hut) by KAMO no Mabuchi and "Eiga Monogatari" (A Tale of Flowering Fortunes) by ⁇  YOSHIDA, he is referred to as one of the three major Japanese history and sequels.
It is pointed out that some similar books are found in "Gizan Zakki" (Gizan) edited by Yi ⁇  (Gizan) who lived in the late Tang Dynasty, and similar books are not found.
According to the ⁇  written at the end of the book, when Naidaijin (the Minister of the Interior) FUJIWARA no Teishi, who was still young at that time, presented a copy of "Shiki" to her younger sister, Chugu (the second consort of an emperor) FUJIWARA no Teishi and Emperor Ichijo, Sei Shonagon answered, 'The Emperor made a copy of "Shiki", but the Emperor answered, 'The Emperor is a samurai.'
And the name comes from the fact that Miya-gami was granted to the Imperial Palace (according to Noin-bon (a three-volume edition), Noin-bon (a book written by Noin), Noin-bon (a complete edition of "Makura no Soshi") and Noin-bon (complete edition) 'This is the makura-ni makura-me,' which is a complete edition of the manuscript written by Noin-bon (a complete edition of Sakai-bon, Sakai-bon, Maeda-bon and Maeda-bon.)
It is commonly believed that the name 'Makura no soshi' came from this.
According to "The Study of Makura no soshi" (The Pillow Book) written by Kazuhiko HAYASHI, there are some scholars such as ⁇ , Shinobu ORIGUCHI, and ⁇  HAYASHI in the past.
The following is a representative theory about the meaning of makura.
The theory of bed ⁇ : a pun called 'Shiki (the Chinese Historical Records) Tata no makura' (lit. "The Pillow of Shiki" [the Chinese Historical Records], "Shiki" [the Chinese Historical Records], and "Shiki" [the Chinese Historical ⁇ ]).
The theory of ⁇ s of writers: it is because there are many chapters which include utamakura (a place famed in classical Japanese poetry), kokoro ( ⁇ ), kokoro ( ⁇ ), and terms.
The theory of Bibisashiroku: it means a book that should be kept in the makura as ⁇ roku.
The ⁇ -bon▁theory
Non- ⁇ ▁theory
However, there is no popular theory.
In " ⁇ " (The Mirror of the Present), 'Makura no soshi' (the Pillow Book) was used as a common noun to describe beautiful ⁇  colors.
According to the " ⁇ " ( ⁇  of court nobles), the first manuscript was written around ⁇ , and MINAMOTO no Tsunefusa was brought from the family of the author to the public.
After that, he was never heard of again, and there is a writing that seems to have been written around the end of the Kanko era.
In the text of "Makura no soshi" (The Pillow Book), which is described in an old commentary of The Tale of Genji, there is a description that the text of "Makura no soshi" (The Pillow Book) doesn't exist today, so it is considered to be a complicated process.
In this book, the difference between the two characters is large.
It takes a form of miscellaneous, and consists of three volumes.
The okugaki (postscript) of 1228 by FUJIWARA no Teika, who is thought to be FUJIWARA no Teika's great-grandfather and Guo.
It is considered that it is the oldest and closer to the old form because it is easily understood as 'Letters and ⁇ .'
It was classified into two categories according to the Liquor Tax Act.
Group 1 (type): The first edition starts with 'The Tale of Genji,' which starts with 'The Tale of Genji,' including 'The Tale of Sagoromo,' and starts with 'The Tale of the Bamboo ⁇ .'
It consists of 230 stories.

Mitsuo ⁇ , possessed by the ⁇  Library, possessed by the ⁇  family, possessed by the Date family, possessed by the Date family, possessed by the ⁇  family, possessed by the Naka ⁇  family, possessed by the Azusado Library.
It is said that Noin Hoshi (a sister of Sei Shonagon was a wife of TACHIBANA no Norinaga, a biological child of Sei Shonagon) was related to Sei Shonagon.
It dates back to the end of the Kamakura period.
With respect to the three-volume edition, it is almost an established theory that the origin of Noinbon is inferior to that of the ⁇ -bon.
It consists of 230 tales excluding 70 tales at the beginning.
300▁tales
Its shape is similar to that of ⁇ .
It is a denpon ( ⁇  book) written in the Muromachi period.
The name of Sakaibon is derived from the fact that the book owned by Domo, a monk who lived in Sakai, was transcribed by KIYOHARA no ⁇ .
It consists of two volumes.
The diary and the ⁇  chapter are missing.
 ⁇ -in Temple book: ⁇ ▁stories
There is a sequel that says it was transcribed by KAMO no Mabuchi.
It is a ⁇  book.
It consists of ⁇  stories.
It is a combination of two types mentioned above.
In general, Sakaibon refers to this.
It consists of ten volumes and seven stories.
It consists of 2 volumes 89 stories.
It consists of 103 volumes.
It consists of 32 tales.
Volume 5 ( ⁇ ) ? -▁?
Its shape is similar to that of ⁇ .
There is only the manuscript handed down to the Maeda family in Kaga Province and the Maeda family (owned by Maeda Ikutokukai).
He entered a gold-lacquered box in gold ⁇  (gold lacquer sprinkled with gold or silver powder), and there is a description in "Sei Shonagon Makura no Soshi" (The Pillow Book).
It is designated as an Important Cultural Property.
It is the oldest manuscript in the manuscript of "Makura no soshi" (the Pillow Book), transcribed by FUJIWARA no Yukinari.
Among them, the ⁇ -in manuscript of the Sakaibon line is included in " ⁇  ⁇ " (Collection of historical documents compiled by Hokiichi ⁇ ) and the three books of Sakaibon are included in "Shin ⁇  ⁇ " (New Classified Documents).
Moreover, because Noinbon was used as the original text for old printed books in the early Edo period (the early Edo period), it was combined with commentaries such as "Makura no Soshi" (The Pillow Book) and "Makura no soshi Harutomisho" (The Pillow Book) (by Kigin ⁇ ).
However, in 1946, the book was re- ⁇  by ⁇  TANAKA (1917-1987), and after the World War II, the book was mostly published and adopted as textbooks.
On the other hand, there is a painting called "Makura no Soshi ⁇ " (picture scroll of the Pillow Book), which seems to have been written in the three-volume  ⁇  style, and a picture scroll depicting the late Kamakura period, "Makura no soshi ⁇ " (picture scroll of the Pillow Book), which is said to have been written in the late Kamakura period, still exists.
The class 2 of the three-volume book has more than 300 chapters independent.
It consists of 'Ruiju-shodan,' which is represented by 'Sushi-no-hana,' 'Suki-no-hana,' 'Ushi-no-hana,' 'Utsuku-mono,' 'Kuzusa-no-dan,' ' ⁇ -sho-dan,' which observations the nature of the four seasons, ' ⁇ -sho-dan,' ' ⁇ -no-sho,' which is the author of the work of Teishi, and so on.
However, the way of classification is unclear (e.g. 'Haruha wa haru' in the first section is generally accepted, but there are different opinions).
It is written in a simple and simple style using the  ⁇  style, and is often written in a simple style, but reflecting the ⁇  of the downfall of the Nakanokanpaku family as well as the death of the lord and the empress of Teishi, some of them exchanged ⁇  wounds at that time.
In contrast to "Genji Monogatari" (The Tale of Genji), the sophisticated sensitivity of the author and sharp observations of the things, he made him appear in the world of 'harmony' in ⁇  with the ⁇  'aware' of "Genji Monogatari."
A positive▁evaluation
In "Makura no soshi" (the Pillow Book), she was deeply loved by people and nature, so she received and formed a variety of colors as the beauty of polyphonic colors ( ⁇ saku KAMEDA).
Depending on the ⁇  which is associated from the next to the next, each chapter does not distinguish the ⁇ s, zuiso (deities and ⁇ s), zuiso ( ⁇ s and ⁇ s), and tenmaku (drafts) are ⁇ ed by the expression of tenmaku (drafts).
The expression of ' ⁇  -  ⁇ ' (e.g.,  ⁇ ) (e.g.,  ⁇ ) is a new style in which people who were familiar with the traditional Japanese culture, such as ' ⁇  - kacho' (literally, spring - morning) which was seen at the time, tried to challenge the hard-line ⁇  of the readers who were familiar with waka tradition (a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables) (Sori FUJIMOTO).
It appears to show respect to Chugu Teishi.
It was written in order to calm the soul of Teishi, who died during the ⁇  of the Michitaka family.
Therefore, it is natural that Michitaka's family declined (this is the same).
Even in the period when people who took care of chugu (the second consort of an emperor) and chugu (the second consort of an emperor) were disappointed, he insisted that he lived in the world of beauty and ⁇  without any favor of the Emperor ( ⁇ ri UENO).

He was so ⁇  that he couldn't forget the class of Sei Shonagon and tried to ⁇  him into the upper class (according to Shuzan ⁇ ).
(There is no honorific language for those who have a high social status as well as their relatives.)
According to 'the record of civilization in the kokyu' (empress's residence), it was not written by the qualification of ' ⁇ ' (according to Koji ISHIDA).
Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA was the 15th Seii Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) (reigned from December 5, 1866 to December 9, 1867).
He was the only shogun who did not perform his duties as Shogun at Edo-jo Castle.
He was Naidaijin (minister of the center) Juichii (Junior First Rank) Grand Cordon of the Order of the Sacred Treasure.
He was a member of the House of Peers (Japan).
After the death of the 14th Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA, who acted as a guardian for the Shogun, he became the 15th Shogun of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
After returning the government to the Emperor Meiji (= Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor), he aimed at kobu- ⁇  ( ⁇  of the imperial court and the shogunate); however, in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi after the Restoration of Imperial Rule (Japan), he left the former Shogunate forces and left Osaka-jo Castle; he was ordered by the Imperial Court to track down and kill Edo-jo Castle without bloodshed.
When he was put under house arrest in the Meiji period, he devoted himself to his ⁇  and lived in the Taisho period as a prince.
Yoshinobu' is also called 'Yoshinobu' or 'Keiki' as his common name.
According to the official documents of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) when he was in office, he was called 'Yoshihisa.'
In his signature and English-language newspaper written by himself, his name is also written as ' ⁇ .'
In Mito City, where he was born, he is often called 'Yoshinobu,' but he is often called 'Keiki' in ⁇  where he spent the rest of his life.
According to a person who knew Yoshinobu while he was alive, Yoshinobu himself seemed to have been fond of 'Keiki-sama,' and he called himself 'Keiki' in his ⁇  to his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA.
It is said that Yoshihisa TOKUGAWA, who succeeded Yoshinobu, was also called 'Keikyu-sama' by the people around him as well as Yoshinobu.
Although the two names of 'Keiki-sama' and 'Keiki-san' can be confirmed at present, the names of 'Keiki-san' are not limited to Shizuoka but they can be confirmed in various parts of Shizuoka, and they are often used in both cases.
Although it is said that 'there are many people who are called "Keiki" in the family line of people related to the ⁇ -ha (supporters of the Shogun), some people of the Higo Domain, who were involved in the overthrow of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), were not able to use them in the ⁇ -ha (supporters of the Shogun), so there is a possibility that they were ⁇  at the ⁇ -ha (supporters of the Shogun) or ⁇  at the ⁇ -ha (supporters of the Shogun).
On October 29, ⁇ , he was born as the seventh son of Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA, the ninth lord of the Mito Domain in ⁇ , Edo.
His mother was Shogun, whose lawful wife was Princess Yoshiko (the third Shogun, Iemitsu TOKUGAWA's lawful wife).
However, it is said that Iemitsu's real mother was Oe no kata, Hidetada's lawful wife, but there is also a theory that Kasuga no tsubone was her real mother.
His childhood name was ⁇ maro.
In accordance with Nariaki's educational policy, he moved to the Mito Domain seven months after he was born, and in the meantime, he was taught academics and martial arts from Shoin YOSHIDA and Seisai ⁇  to the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family.
It seems that Yoshinobu's ⁇  was ⁇  at that time, and at the beginning, Nariaki didn't have an adopted son to other families, and he thought that he would remain in the care of his eldest son (the eldest son) ⁇  TOKUGAWA.
On September 1, ⁇ , he was ordered by the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) to inherit ⁇ maro as the heir of the Hitotsubashi family.
In response to this, ⁇ maro returned to the Hitotsubashi family on September 1 and was granted a portion of the real name of Yoshinobu by the 12th Shogun Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA in December.
Ieyoshi repeatedly visited the Hitotsubashi residence and thought that Yoshinobu would be an influential candidate for the heir to the Shogun, but he gave up because of the advice of Masahiro ABE, roju (member of shogun's council of elders).
In 1853, in the confusion during the arrival of the Black Ships, Shogun Ieyoshi died of disease and the 13th Shogun Iesada TOKUGAWA, who succeeded to the position of Shogun, was sickly, and the issue of 'Word the heir to the Shogun' became ⁇  (the issue of the heir to the Shogun).
The O-oku (the inner halls of Edo Castle where the wife of the Shogun and her servants reside) group was formed by Nariaki TOKUGAWA, Masahiro ABE, the lord of the Satsuma Domain, and Keifuku TOKUGAWA, the lord of the Kishu Domain, whose real mother was Naosuke II and Iesada's real mother, Honjuin.
The Hitotsubashi group tried to put Tenshoin, an adopted daughter of Nariakira SHIMAZU, into O-oku (the inner halls of Edo Castle where the wife of the Shogun and her servants reside), into O-oku (the inner halls of Edo Castle where the wife of the Shogun and her servants reside), but after Masahiro ABE and Nariakira SHIMAZU died one after another, Naosuke II, who became Tairo (chief minister), ruled that 'the heir to the Shogun is ⁇  TOKUGAWA.'
In the same year, Naosuke II signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan without Imperial sanction.
Yoshinobu, together with Nariaki and Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA, the lord of Fukui Domain, questioned Nariaki TOKUGAWA about the incident, but he was not involved in the incident and was confined to his house in 1859 (Ansei no Taigoku [ ⁇  of ⁇  by the Shogunate]).
In addition, Yoshinobu himself did not want to become the heir to the Shogun, so he sent a letter to Nariaki saying, 'I don't want to do so because of my failure from bringing the whole country to the world.'
In 1860, he was suspended from house arrest.
In 1862, Imperial envoys, ⁇  ⁇ , came to Edo to guard the Satsuma clan led by Hisamitsu SHIMAZU, and Emperor Komei ordered him to appoint Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA as Shogun-kokenshoku (guardian of the Shogun) and Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA (Keiei) as Tairo (chief minister).
On July 6, the bakufu appointed Yoshinobu to Shogun-kokenshoku and ⁇  to Seiji sosaishoku.
Yoshinobu and ⁇  attempted to reform the shogunate government, which was called Bunkyu Reform, to establish Kyoto ⁇  (Military governor of Kyoto) and ease ⁇  (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo).
In 1863, he went to Kyoto as a member of Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA's council of elders, and made every effort to negotiate with the Imperial Court to expel foreigners.
When Emperor Komei visited Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine to pray for the expulsion of foreigners, the Emperor told him to carry out Joi (expulsion of foreigners) and that he would carry out the expulsion of foreigners, so he ordered Iemochi to have an audience with him.
When the Sonno Joi ha (supporters of the doctrine of restoring the emperor and expelling the barbarians) led by the Choshu clan was expelled in the Coup of August 18 (August 18 under the old lunar calendar), he went up to Kyoto to participate in the Sanyo-kaigi ( ⁇  of the imperial court and the shogunate) in cooperation with Kobu Gattai ( ⁇  of the imperial court and the shogunate) and ⁇  ( ⁇  of the shogunate).
However, it could be said that the conference was ⁇  and drunk at a drinking party with Imperial Prince Kuninomiya ⁇ , abusing ⁇ , Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Taruhito, and Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Taruhito, and furthermore, he said to Nakagawa no Miya, 'I'm going out of the Shimazu family,' which caused him to collapse.
After that, he was appointed to Kinri Goshuei Sotoku (Governor-general of the Imperial Palace) by the Imperial Court in Kyoto, and along with Katamori MATSUDAIRA (the lord of the Aizu Domain), ⁇  MATSUDAIRA (the lord of the Kuwana Domain) and Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA (the lord of the Kuwana Domain), he was a loyal supporter of the Emperor and kuge (court nobles) (Ichikaiso, Aizu and Kuwana Domains).
In the Tenguto no Ran ( ⁇  of Tenguto), he showed his coolness to cut off the vassals of his family, the Mito Domain, including ⁇ sai TAKEDA, who supported Yoshinobu.
In 1864, he attacked the army of bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) in the Kinmon Incident and attacked the Choshu army which occupied the Takatsukasa residence.
After that, he was involved in the first conquest of Choshu and succeeded in obtaining the imperial sanction for the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan without imperial sanction.
In the second conquest of Choshu in 1866, Yoshinobu received an imperial order to ⁇  the Satsuma Domain's ⁇ .
However, due to the Satsuma Domain's rejection of the dispatch of troops to the Satsuma Domain, the bakufu army was defeated.
On July 20, during the second conquest of Choshu, Shogun Iemochi died in Osaka-jo Castle.
Yoshinobu, who aimed at the Imperial Court, gave an imperial rescript to restart the war, and concluded the ⁇ -fire agreement.
He was recommended as the successor of Iemochi, but Yoshinobu refused it.
Although the Tokugawa Shogun family succeeded to the position of shogun on September 20 (August 20 under the old lunar calendar), he refused to assume the position of shogun.
After that, roju (member of shogun's council of elders) consulted with Sadanobu MATSUDAIRA, but he did not accept the offer, and on December 5, he was appointed as Shogun by Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Taruhito (Emperor Komei).
This was, in other words, to become a shogun by selling favors, and there was a tendency to take advantage of politics.
Yoshinobu, with the support of ⁇  dollars from France through Leon Leon Roches, a French minister, established ⁇  Seitetsusho and Shusensho, and carried out the military organization to reform military systems such as Jurchen.
He also encouraged his students to study in Europe, such as sending his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA to the Paris World ⁇ .
In the issue of the opening of the port of Hyogo, he advocated the Imperial Court and received imperial sanction.
Yoshinobu, who was ⁇  to 'the secret Imperial command to overthrow the Shogunate,' reported to the throne to the Imperial Court on October 14, 1867, and the next day, the Imperial sanction was given (Taisei-hokan).
It is said that at that time, the Imperial Court did not have administrative abilities, and the Tokugawa government was led by the council of feudal lords.
However, in the plot of Toshimichi OKUBO and Tomomi IWAKURA, who aimed to overthrow the Shogunate, the Decree for the Restoration of Imperial Rule was issued in December, and Yoshinobu was ordered to 'Jikan-nochi' (resigned by the Minister of the Center and dedicated by the Tokugawa family).
Yoshinobu left Osaka-jo Castle in order to avoid a conflict, and he advocated Tokugawa ⁇  (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family) with the ministers of foreign countries, and also requested the Imperial Court to change Jikannochi (an Imperial demesne) to a ⁇ .
In the following year, 1868, however, he raised an army in response to the Decree for the Restoration of Imperial Rule which was carried out by the Satsuma Domain, and he withdrew from Kyoto using Aizu and Kuwana Domains.
However, the army of the former bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) retreated to Edo in "Kaiyo-maru" (Kaiyo-maru), despite the fact that the army of the former bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) was ⁇  in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi that broke out on January▁3.
Soon after, an order to hunt down and kill Yoshinobu as the Emperor's enemy was issued, and the government army led by Imperial Prince Arisugawanomiya Taruhito, the great general, started the eastern expedition.
Yoshinobu insisted on the ⁇  of the resistance force, ⁇ ing Tadamasa ⁇ .
In February, he was assigned to Kaishu KATSU and placed under house arrest at Daiji-in of Ueno Kanei-ji Temple.
His adopted son Kamenosuke TAYASU (later Tatsunari TOKUGAWA) succeeded to the head of the Tokugawa family.
When Katsu and Takamori SAIGO, a staff officer of the government army and a staff officer of the government, surrendered the Edo-jo Castle without bloodshed, Yoshinobu's wedding was moved to Mito and he stayed in the room of ⁇ -kan, a ⁇  (domain school).

On December 8, he retired.
He died on November 22, 1913 (at four o'clock in the morning).
On the same day, he was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun with ⁇  Flower.
As for the study of military arts and learning, he was born in the highest environment and was enthusiastic about the art of ⁇  from various martial arts.
Even after Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor), he continued to practice ⁇  every day, and he is considered to be the most famous person among the masters of ⁇ -jutsu.
When his father ⁇  was bedridden and bedridden as a problem when the successor of the Tokugawa family was to be the successor of the Tokugawa family, he was placed on the bedside (it is said that the sword was just a threat and the sword was removed when he was sleeping).
On the other hand, there is an anecdote that when he was in bed after his coming-of-age ceremony, he was ⁇  together with his two wives and concubines as a measure to assassinate.
Although there is a picture which is said to be Yoshinobu's photograph, it is not clear whether the photograph was made by Yoshinobu himself or not in Japan.
He visited Iemochi when he fell ill, and it is said that he was ⁇  by ordinary people at that time.
He was known for his ⁇ ness and ⁇  AJIMA, who was a trusted vassal of his biological father, Nariaki TOKUGAWA, described Yoshinobu as 'a ⁇  man who ⁇  the Tokugawa lineage,' and he was praised as 'recompetent by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA's return to the position of shogun, and he was praised as 'recompetent by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.'
Yoshinobu's sided with the overthrow of the Shogunate, and especially Takayoshi KIDO of the Choshu clan said, 'It is impossible to ⁇  Yoshinobu ⁇ 's ⁇ .
Ieyasu seemed to come again.'
In response to the decision of Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor), Ryoma SAKAMOTO said, 'The shogun (Shogun), is the ⁇  of today's mind.
Even if you don't get it well, you will never lose it well.
It was so ⁇  that Yoshinobu tried to give him the position of vice Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor) of the new government, 'I will abandon my life for the public.'
However, it was in the Meiji period when Yoshinobu came to know the existence of Ryoma (Ryoma's death).
There is no story about Yoshinobu, and it is very interesting that Ryoma, who was alive, was compared to those after the Meiji Restoration.
After he was defeated in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, he fled to Edo and was greatly criticized by his enemies, 'Tekimae ran away'.
On this occasion, the golden fan, which had been used by Ieyasu, was placed in front of him, but there were some people who did not forget about it and ⁇  the weakness of Yoshinobu.
However, some people say that at that time there was no way to resist the armed uprising in Edo and Musashi Provinces, and that it was necessary to prevent territorial lords from ⁇ ing Osaka-jo Castle due to the fact that Yoshinobu became the Emperor's enemy, and that the long-term war was required to defend the Osaka-jo Castle.
On the other hand, due to the fact that he was regarded as the Emperor's enemy by the new government, and the fact that he was confined in Kanei-ji Temple as well as the fact that he was confined to Kanei-ji Temple (Mitogaku, which is thought to have been influenced by Mitogaku (the scholarship and academic traditions that arose in the Mito Domain) and his mother from the Imperial Court), he was said to have been 'not weak' because he was ⁇ ed by the enemy as a lord.
Due to his suspension of allegiance and the surrender of Edo Muketsu-jo Castle, he was forced to transfer his political power to the new government, which was close to the bloodless revolution, he was recognized as a great achievement in the Meiji Restoration.
As a businessman, he was a retainer of the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family when he was the head of the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family, and he was also promoted after the Meiji Restoration.
In the later years of Yoshinobu's life, ⁇ sawa, who was seeking to compile the biography of Yoshinobu, opened the ' ⁇ mu Yume-kai' ( ⁇  of the past), in which he heard about Yoshinobu's ⁇ .
"Konjaku Yume-e ⁇ " (Ancient ⁇ s of Dreams) was compiled.
In the chapter recorded in some zadane, the voice of Yoshinobu, who was a relative of Yoshinobu, can be seen.
It can be seen that his personality and mind at that time were ⁇  by the fact that he was such a bad person as he was at the age of one's age as he said, 'I didn't like me very much,' and 'I am an ⁇  person.'
The " ⁇  of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA" was completed based on these materials.
Since he was pardoned as an enemy of the Imperial Court, he left a will to show his gratitude to Emperor Meiji, who was given the highest rank of the peerage, that is, Yoshinobu's funeral was not a Buddhist ceremony, but a Shinto ceremony.
Because of this, Yoshinobu's grave was not found in the graveyard of the Tokugawa family in Kanei-ji Temple, which was the ancestral temple of the Tokugawa family, but in Taninaka Reien, a round ⁇  with the Imperial Family was built.
This was due to the fact that the imperial mausoleum of Emperor Komei was simpler (according to " ⁇  of Yoshinobu ⁇ ").
Katsukiyo ⁇ , a roju (member of shogun's council of elders) at that time, expressed his regrets about Yoshinobu's life without worrying about Yoshinobu's life after the pardon, and later, Katsukiyo ⁇ , a roju (member of shogun's council of elders) at that time, said, 'I regret this act together with Yoshinobu.'
Although he had a strong image in 'the enemy's escape' in the Genroku Ako Incident, in recent years he tried to establish a new cabinet after Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor), and in addition to the broadcast of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA (NHK Taiga drama), he has been re- ⁇ .
Like his father Nariakira, pork was a favorite food of the Satsuma Domain, and it was called "Butaichi-sama" (meaning one bridge like pork).
He was also interested in Western literary works, and in his later years, he seemed to have been interested in shooting, fishing, ⁇ , ⁇ , tegei (embroidery), and so on, but he was ⁇  by ⁇  NISHI (illuminator).
He was famous as a ⁇ man, but it seems that he did not improve the technique of filming.
He often contributed a photo magazine, but it is said that he did not use it for a long time.
His great-grandson, ⁇  TOKUGAWA, was also a freelancer, and his photograph, including the photograph taken by Yoshinobu, was found in the house of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA, and it was published and edited.
His younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA was a friend of such a ⁇  life.
On December 3, 1855, he married ⁇  ICHIJO (he changed his name to Yasuko ⁇  after the Meiji Restoration).
He and Biga were born on July 16, 1858, when his eldest daughter (the daughter of Keikoin-dono) was born, but they died young.
Since then, she did not have any children with ⁇ , and the 10th son and 11 daughters born in the Meiji period were all children with their two concubines.
The seventh son, ⁇ , who became a ⁇  and took over the family of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA, the tenth son, ⁇ , who became Kaishu KATSU's adopted son-in-law, and the ninth daughter, Tsuneko, who became the wife of Imperial Prince Fushiminomiya Hiroyasu, were among them.
His children were ⁇  TOKUGAWA and Princess Kikuko, the wife of Imperial Prince Nobuhito, who became the wife of Imperial Prince Nobuhito.

▁Note
Nara Line is a railway (JR West) railway line operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West) from Kizu Station (Kyoto Prefecture) in the Fushimi Ward of Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture to Kyoto Station in Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.
The entire line is included in the metropolitan suburban section.
Because this station is a terminal for the Kansai Main Line, the official starting point is Kizu Station; however, the outbound train from Kyoto to Kizu Station is the outbound train (the ⁇  number is the odd number), and the reverse is the inbound train (the same number is the same as that of the train).
Except for the following data, it will be described in the direction from Kyoto to Kizu.
Its selection is brown ( ⁇ ), and the reason why the selection is said to be 'an image of an old city connecting two ancient capitals.'
Administration ( ⁇  type): West Japan Railway Company ( ⁇  business operator)
Railway distance (operation kilometers): 34.7▁km
Track gauge: ⁇ ▁mm
Number of stations: 19 (including the starting and terminal stations)
 ⁇ -track section: Shinden - Uji section, JR ⁇  - Kyoto▁section
 ⁇ ed section: entire line (DC 1500V)
 ⁇  ( ⁇ ): A ⁇  block system (track section), single track automatic block system (track section)
 ⁇  device: A ⁇  Train Stop▁system
Operation center: Shin-Osaka General Operation▁Center
M ⁇  speed: ⁇  km/h ( ⁇  speed), ⁇  km/h (track section)
Except for Kizu Station, Kizu Station is under the jurisdiction of the West Japan Railway Company Kyoto Branch (Kizu Station is managed by the Osaka Branch Office of the West Japan Railway Company).
The line between Kyoto and Kizu is named the Nara Line, but the entire line is in Kyoto Prefecture and there is no route in Nara Prefecture.
This is due to the background that the line between Kyoto and Nara was originally constructed by Nara Railway, but after the Kansai Railway was merged into the Kansai Railway, the line south of Kizu was separated as a part of the route between Osaka and Nagoya.
However, trains are operated from Kizu Station to Nara Station on the Kansai Main Line (Yamatoji Line).
JR West decided the name of the line (such as JR Kyoto Line and JR Kobe Line) on the line of the Urban Network on March 13, 1988, but the Nara Line was ⁇ .
Kintetsu Nara Line is also called 'JR Nara Line' because Kintetsu Nara Line is located on the Kintetsu Nara Line.
In the era of Japan National Railways, 'JR Nara Line' was referred to as ' ⁇  Nara Line,' and 'JNR' was also written on the information board.
The Kintetsu Nara Line is in rivalry with the Yamatoji Line between Nanba and Nara, and the JR Nara Line is in rivalry with the Kintetsu Kyoto Line.
While many trains operated in parallel with the Keihanshin Local Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line had been operated until 1984 at the end of the JNR era, the Nara Line wasn't electrified until the end of the JNR era, and even after the electrification, only two-car trains of the JNR/JR ⁇  Trains Series 105 were used for a while.
However, after JR West was established and the line was incorporated into the Urban Network, trains were converted into four-car trains (some of them were six-car trains), double-car trains were double- ⁇ , and the number of rapid trains including the ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' increased rapidly.
Currently, the characteristics of this route are the sightseeing tours to Byodo-in Temple in Uji City, along the line, as well as the route from the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, such as Uji City, Kyoto Prefecture.
However, it is ⁇  to the east between Momoyama Station and Shinden Station, and in the south of Joyo Station, the Kintetsu Kyoto Line runs parallel to the outside of the city; therefore, the Kintetsu Kyoto Line, which runs in the south of Joyo City, still continues to transport both the ⁇  and the area.
The rolling stock used by the Nara Train Depot, a branch of the Osaka Branch Office, is managed by the Kyoto office except for Kizu Station.
J- ⁇ , ICOCA, Suica of the East Japan Railway Company (JR East), ⁇  of the Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central), and PiTaPa of KANSAI  ⁇  ⁇  can be used at all stations.
In the south of Joyo Station, the ticket gate is a simple ticket gate because the ticket gate is also unmanned.
Since the operation of the Limited Express 'Kuroshio' (train) that ran between Kyoto and Wakayama via the Nara Line, Sakurai Line and Wakayama Line was discontinued in 1984, local trains were operated only by local trains (as in the case of limited express trains, they were operated temporarily), but now four types of type of rapid trains, rapid trains, local trains, and local trains are used.
This type of train is the highest rapid train on the Nara Line, and is mainly operated during the daytime.
Basically, local trains make connections with local trains at intervals of 30 minutes.
The nickname ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' was decided by the general public in front of the Miyafuku Line.
It is used not only by Japanese but also by foreigners as a sightseeing train connecting Kyoto and Nara, which is a tourist spot.
The rolling stock used is the JR (West) ⁇  Train Series 221, which is four-car or six-car train.
In the morning rush, trains are operated at ⁇  km/h in the morning and at ⁇  km/h in the morning.
The standard time is approximately 44 minutes from Kyoto to Nara, and 47 minutes from Nara to Kyoto.
As trains bound for Kyoto stop at Kamikoma Station or Tanakura Station on the way, they stop at two minutes, and the travel time is slightly different from that of Miyakoji Rapid Service in Nara.
During the first three days of the New Year, a special train would stop at Inari Station to visit ⁇ -jinja Shrine.
▁History
March 3, 2001: The station was upgraded to an unmanned station.
March 15, 2003: With the timetable revision, trains began making stops at ⁇  Station and Tamamizu Station.
It is operated during the morning rush hour.
They also stop at JR Ogura Station and Shinden Station (Kyoto Prefecture) where ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' passes.
The JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series ⁇  is operated with four-car or six-car trains.
Basically, local trains make connections with local trains at intervals of 30 minutes.
Like the Miyakoji Rapid Service mentioned above, the Narayama Station stops at which rapid trains on the Yamatoji Line stop.
Until March 2001 when ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' started, the stops were Kyoto, Uji, Joyo, Kizu and Nara, while JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series 113 were used for the cars, but they were not used in the Nara Line.
There is a direct train to the Yamatoji Line in order to operate trains on the Osaka Loop Line.
It is operated mainly in the morning and at night.
Although it was initially operated only on weekdays, it began to be operated on ⁇  and holidays from March 18,▁2006.
Although the trains between Uji Station and Uji Station didn't stop at every station, the trains for Kizu Station once ran in the morning and late at night, but now the trains that ran in front of the Osaka Loop Line were changed to the terminal station to run in front of the Miyafuku Line.
One of the trains departing from Kyoto at ⁇ 00 on ⁇  and holidays is the JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series 103, all of which are operated on the Series ⁇ .
The Yamatoji Line runs directly from the Yamatoji Line due to the convenience of operation on the Osaka Loop Line.
The rapid express trains on the Nara Line used the color of the same color as ' ⁇ ji Rapid' and ' ⁇  Rapid Service,' but due to the revision of the timetable made in March 2008, the type of train-cars on the Osaka Loop Line ceased to be used.
The display of the stations to the north of Kamikoma Station is described in the  ⁇  characters.
They run between Kyoto Station, Uji Station, Joyo Station and Uji Station.
During the daytime, the train runs every 15 minutes between Kyoto Station and Joyo Station, but it takes 30 minutes between Joyo Station and Kizu Station.
Basically, the trains are operated with the 103 series, but some of them are operated with the ⁇  series.
There are some trains that go directly to the Yamatoji Line early in the morning and late at night due to the convenience of operation.
In the past, there was a connection between the Sakurai Line and the Sakurai Line, but on September 4, 1994, the Nara Line and the Sakurai Line were separated.
Although it is a special train, trains were sometimes operated on the Nara Line.
From 1987 to 1988, the nickname 'Kuroshio' was used for the JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series 381, which ran between Kyoto and Shirahama via the Kansai Main Line, the Hanwa Freight Line and the Hanwa Line.
According to the Kinki edition of the Nara Electric Railway Co., Ltd. on January 6, 1998, the operation of the limited express was announced at the Nara Line for the first time in 2001 (it was announced that the Limited Express Series 381 was operated as a regular train), but the plan was cancelled later.
There was a time when the Miyakoji Leisure was operated between Kyoto and Sakurai (the Miyakoji Rapid Service was the Miyakoji Rapid Service), but currently there is no direct operation to the Sakurai Line including the special rapid train.
In the middle of August, the Uji-gawa River Hanabi-tai (fire festival) was held in the direction of the Uji-gawa River, but it was operated in a special schedule from 16:00 to the last time, since the train couldn't secure the transport capacity, and after 16 a.m., all local trains were operated only in ten minutes between Kyoto Station and Uji Station.
Some local trains arrive at and depart from Kizu Station.
At that time, the first three days of the new year became a special timetable for a single track, and the rapid trains ran between Kyoto and Uji, as well as the frequency of operation up to Uji.
Depending on the year, some shuttle trains were installed at Momoyama Station.
Around 1992, the special rapid service to the Sakurai Line was extended mainly on Saturday and holidays, and one hour up to Tenri Station.
In addition, there are some trains that are exclusively operated by organizations throughout Japan.
Especially at Tenrikyo-taisai Festival on October 26 every year, the trains called ' ⁇  train bound for Tenri' run from Kyoto Station to Nara Station via the Nara Line, Kizu Station, Yamatoji Line, Nara Station, Nara Station and Sakurai Line.
All of them belong to the Nara Train Depot.
JR (West) ⁇  Train Series<unk>
It is commonly operated with the Yamatoji Line and the Osaka Loop Line, and there are two-car trains, four-car trains and six-car trains.
Miyakoji Rapid Service and Rapid Service are mainly used for four-car trains or six-car trains, but four-car trains are operated on the Nara Line.
Two-car trains and two-car trains are found on the holiday schedule.
JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series▁103
The 103 series cars used for local trains on the Nara Line are operated not only on the Nara Line but on the Nara Line but also on the Osaka Loop Line and the Yamatoji Line during the rush hour.
Some cars are replaced with cars transferred from Morinomiya Train Depot.
Nara Railway opened the line between Kyoto Station and Kizu Station, but the line between Kyoto Station and Momoyama Station at first ran the route of the current Kintetsu Kyoto Line.
On the day of 1921 when the section between ⁇  (now Zeze) and Kyoto via the Tokaido Main Line was replaced by the Higashiyama Tunnel, the old Tokaido Main Line and the new line between Inari Station and Momoyama Station became the Nara Line, and the section between Kyoto Station and Fushimi Station was abolished and the line between Fushimi Station and Momoyama Station became a freight line.

Keiji Bypass is a general Bypass of the National Highway from Kusatsu City, Shiga Prefecture to Joyo City, Kyoto Prefecture.
It is designated as a plan for local high- ⁇  highways.
The following is the Keiji Bypass of the Yuryo Bypass, followed by the National Route 1, and then the Keiji Bypass of the National Route 24.
It is ⁇  with Meishin Expressway and connects the direction of Kuritto-higashi Interchange, Nagoya City and the direction of ⁇  Interchange and Osaka City through the streets of Otsu City and Kyoto City.
Under the law, the Seta Higashi Interchange - the Kumiyama-Yodo Interchange is designated as a national highway (Keiji Bypass) on National Route 1 and 478 and the Kumiyama-Yodo Interchange on National Route 478, and the Kumiyama-Yodo Interchange on National Road 478 is a high- ⁇  high- ⁇  highway (a private road exclusively for the National Highway Road No. 478) based on the designation of the Minister for Land, ⁇ , Transport and Tourism; the Oyamazaki- Kumiyama Interchange is a national high-speed ⁇  (National Highway Route No. 2 Kyoto-Hodo Road).
In the later plan, a new route linking the Kyoto Tanba Road and the Keiji Bypass, which were the ⁇  Bypass of the National Highway Route No. 9 and the Kyoto Municipal Road No. 9 was created based on the need for the construction of roads with the ⁇  of Meishin Expressway and the ⁇  Line of Kyoto City.
The Kyoto Outer Loop Expressway and the Kyoto Second Outer Ring Road have been designated as National Route ⁇  and improved.
According to the indication of the route, it is easier to use by passengers, and Keiji Bypass is held at Seta Higashi ⁇ -National Park and Oyamazaki ⁇ -National Park.
In addition, there is no difference between the Meishin Expressway and the Keiji Bypass via either route and the ETC discount system.
In this section, when there is no special mention, the Keiji Bypass is referred to as a commercial route (from the Seta-higashi Interchange to the Oyamazaki Interchange).

The Uji Tunnel on this route is 4.13 meters long and 313 meters long, and the tunnel is prohibited except for 500 meters in front of Uji Higashi Interchange and Kasatori Interchange.
Prior to the opening of the Kumiyama ⁇ , filming of "The Biwako ⁇  Line THEVE II" was carried out before the opening.
The distance between the Seta Higashi Interchange and the Oyamazaki Interchange is shorter than that of the Meishin Expressway, and if Keiji Bypass runs slightly shorter than the Meishin Expressway, it will be accessible to the destination via the Keiji Bypass.
Because there are no facilities such as the service area, ⁇  high-speed facilities are often constructed (there are two facilities, one for Meishin Expressway, the other for the Otsu Service Area, and the other for the Katsuragawa Parking Area).
However, because both sides of Seta and Oyamazaki are installed after the name of the god (in particular, the structure of Oyamazaki Branch is very complicated), the number of trains are reduced at the Lamp Department (a ⁇ ).
There is an opinion that if you go from Oyamazaki to ⁇  and arrive at the left route of Meishin Expressway, you will be forced to ⁇  with the left route.
Also, since there are many ⁇ s and slopes along the road, the ⁇  of the Meishin Expressway has not been fully functioning as a ⁇  for the Meishin Expressway.
This road is a ⁇  exclusively for motor vehicles because it is a ⁇  of National Route 1 (National Route 1) and is not a high-speed ⁇ .
If you go from the east side of the Uji-gawa River to the Keiji Bypass of ⁇  and ⁇ , you must go to the Uji-nishi Interchange.
This is because the Uji-higashi Interchange is a ⁇ .
Therefore, during the commuter hours, the general road section between the Uji-higashi Interchange and the Uji-nishi Interchange is often included.
Since this general road section isn't ⁇  with any ⁇ , it is difficult to avoid ⁇ .

Higashi Hongan-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to the Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) located in Kamigyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.
It is the head temple of the Otani school of the Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) and is the head temple of the Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) as well as Nishi Hongan-ji Temple (the head temple of the Hongan-ji Temple (the formal name of Hongan-ji Temple).
The formal name of the temple was 'Hongan-ji Temple' until 1987, and 'Jodo Shinshu Honbyo' in the same year.
It is often called 'Ohigashi-san' in order to distinguish it from Nishi Hongan-ji Temple in the same Shimogyo Ward.
(For more information on the history before the split into east and west, refer to the history of Hongan-ji Temple.)
 ⁇  (Mitsuju) OTANI, the 12th head of Hongan-ji Temple, was given a Jiryo (temple estate) in the east of Hongan-ji Temple by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, and when Hongan-ji Temple was split in 1602, Kosho-ji Temple was founded.
It is located at Shichijo, Karasuma-shichijo, Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City, and came to be called Higashi Hongan-ji Temple because it is located in the east of Nishi Hongan-ji Temple, which is located at Horikawa-Shichijo.
In 1987, Hongan-ji Temple, which had been a religious organization of the Otani school and the Hasshu sect, was legally dissolved and merged with the religious school.
After that, the formal name of Higashi Hongan-ji Temple became 'Shin-shu Honbyo' (Honbyo Mausoleum) ('Honbyo' means the ⁇  dojo (place of Buddhist practice or meditation) and the place where followers of the founder Shinran believe in the teachings of the founder Shinran.)
The Higashi Hongan-ji school of the Jodo Shinshu sect (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) and the Higashi Hongan-ji school of the Jodo Shinshu sect (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) are distinguished and they insist their legitimacy.

Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is a god (Shinto) appearing in Japanese Mythology.
In "the Engishiki" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), 'Amateru' is referred to as 'amateru' when it is enshrined at a shrine as a natural god.
It is a god that deifications the sun, and is considered to be one of the soshin ( ⁇  honored as god) of the Imperial family.
In "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), it is written as Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan).
It is also called Ohirume no Kami.
In "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), there are several names of gods, but in "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters) it is unified as ' ⁇  Omikami' (the Sun Goddess).
Although he is a goddess, there is another theory that he was actually a male god.
As the name of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is used in political parts such as "Kotai jingu gishikicho" (book of ceremonies of Kotai-jingu Shrine) and so on, there is a theory that ⁇  (Takaomusubi no mikoto) was originally the ancestor of the Imperial Family and became Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
In Ise-jingu Shrine, it is usually called Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) or Sume Omikami (the Sun Goddess) or Sume Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
In academic documents, ' ⁇ ' and 'Katakana' are now written in hiragana (Japanese syllabary characters).
In ancient times, there is a theory that it was written as Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
Descriptions in▁mythology
According to "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), Izanagi returned from the ⁇  (world after death) where Izanami lived, and when he washed ⁇  on the left eye, he was born.
At that time, she was called ⁇ ko together with her right eye, ⁇ , and Susanoo.
At that time, Izanagi ordered Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) to ⁇  Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).
Susanoo, who had been entrusted to Haihara, was exiled by Izanagi because he kept saying that he wanted to go to ⁇  where Izanami lived.
Susanoo went to Takamanohara (plain of high heaven) to see his older sister Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) before the conquest of Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains), but Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) thought that the younger brother came to take care of Takamanohara (plain of high heaven), so he was armed and waited for him.
Susanoo made an oath to ⁇  Ashihara no ⁇  (literally, " ⁇  Land of Reed Plains," which refers to the Central Land of Reed Plains, which refers to the human world) from Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess), five male gods from Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess), and three goddesses from Susano's monozane (literally, the three gods), and Susano declared victory.
Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) gave birth to Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess), Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess), and Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) were the following five deities.
Amenooshihomimi
Amenohohi
Amatsuhikone
Ikutsuhikone
Kumanokusubi
Susanoo, who was ⁇  by this, performed ⁇  in Takamanohara (plain of high heaven), and as a result, Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) hid himself in Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains).
The ⁇  became black, and various kinds of disasters occurred.
(Yagokoro no mikoto, the god of Chichibu, and Yaoyorozu no kami (eight million gods) such as Amatsu kami (god of heaven) and Ame no ⁇  no Mikoto, were succeeded by Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess), and Susano was expelled from Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).
Amenooshihomi, the child of Amenooshihomi, was sent to Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains).
After ⁇  (the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess) was suppressed, Amenooshihomimi was ordered to ⁇  Ashihara no ⁇  (literally, "the Central Land of Reed Plains," which refers to the Central Land of Reed Plains, which refers to the human world), but when Ninigi was born, ⁇  Ninigi, the grandson of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
<unk>
In the mythology, it can be said that Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) gave a religious service to the ⁇  (god of heaven) who was born ahead of him, or a scene in which he followed his instructions, and therefore, there is a view that Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) conducted a religious service to the gods to deify the ⁇  of the Emperor itself.
There is also a view that it is a deification of ancient shrine ⁇ .
The other name 'Hirume' refers to a shrine maiden who serves the sun god.
The sun god was originally a male god, but there is a theory that a shrine maiden who served him was identified with the sun god and became a goddess.
According to one theory, Himiko was the model for Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess), because this goddess was established in the era of Empress Jito, the empress.
The origin of 'Me' of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and Tsukuyomi is pointed out in "Reiho Gofujo" (preface of Five  ⁇ s) ( ⁇  6th century) of Taoism and "Kyorisho" (Book of ⁇ ), and in "Keiho ⁇ kyo" (the first half of the 7th century), it is pointed out that 'the eyes of the left eye are regarded as the sun and the moon's eyes are strongly influenced by Dokyo.
In addition, the terms such as Ise-jingu Shrine, Ise-jingu Shrine, where Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is enshrined, Ise-jingu Shrine, Ise-jingu Shrine, ⁇ -no-yakata ( ⁇  of the Ise-jingu Shrine), Murasaki-no- ⁇  ( ⁇  of the Ise-jingu Shrine), ⁇ -no-zo ( ⁇  of the emperor's robe), ⁇ -no-e ( ⁇  of the five colors), ⁇ -no- ⁇  (five colors) and uusu- ⁇ -no-miya Shrine are also ⁇  with Dokyo.
In terms of comparative mythology, it is pointed out that the myth of the birth of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess), including Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess), is almost the same as the Banko myth described in the older age (from the third to the fourth century).
Since both the sun and the moon, which are the sun and the moon, are very popular in Asia, there is a theory that it is a myth that they were introduced to Japan along with the movement of ethnic groups in the preceding history.
According to "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), ⁇  changes into three stages.
The following are the events that are turning and the contents.
 ⁇ : The Taika Reforms were revised.
Before that, the Imperial Family did not enshrine Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
Hinokami' (the sun itself) 'Hi no kami' (the sun itself)
The male god called ' ⁇ teru' is widely known.
In "Engishiki" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), there are shrines with the reading of 'Amateru-jinja Shrine' in Tsushima and 'Amaterutama-jinja Shrine' in Tanba, 'Amaterutama-jinja Shrine' in Tanba.
Incidentally, Amenomateru is another name for Amenohoakari, a grandson of Amaterasu, and Amenohoakari is the founder of the Owari clan, Tsumori clan and Amabe clan.
Additionally, the younger brother of Amenohoakari is Ninigi, the grandson of the Emperor Jinmu.
672: The Jinshin War occurred.
It is called 'Ohirume no Muchi' or 'Tatanabata' in which the sun god is enshrined.
In this case, there is an interpretation that the enshrined deity is Ohiruki, a goddess, and that it is 'Ateru,' a male god of snake.
698: The Kotai-jingu Shrine was founded.
Amaterasu' (the Sun Goddess) and 'the ancestors of the Imperial Family'
She is a goddess.
It was created from nature and humanized as a model by Emperor Jito.
After that, 'Tenteru' other than Kososhin was called ' ⁇ teru.'
For example, in "Shinsen ⁇ " (Newly ⁇  Register of Clan Names and Titles of ⁇ ) (around 1060) it is written as '天 ⁇ 神' and in '天 ⁇ ' of "Sendai ⁇ " (Ancient Japanese History), it is read as 'Ameteru teru bozu.'
1880-1881: Controversy over the Shinto world over the enshrined deity of the Shinto ⁇  Shrine located in Tokyo.
The Shinto ⁇  insisted that the four gods of ⁇  ( ⁇  no kami, ⁇  no kami, ⁇  no kami) and Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) should be enshrined at the shrine of the ⁇ , but the 'Izumo school' stated that the enshrined deity should be collectively called 'Yugenichinyo,' and the enshrined deity should be collectively called 'Akoyo no kami.'
However, Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) was 'the leader of the heaven and the earth,' who was the center of the Shinto ⁇ , and other gods came into conflict with each other, for example, Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) was 'the supreme ruler of the heaven and the earth,' who ruled the two worlds.
In the end, there were various theories, such as 'the Izumo school regards the long-standing grudge of the age from the age of the gods as a ⁇ ,' ' ⁇  the Imperial family should kill Sonfuku SEN, who had a ⁇  mind to the Imperial family.'
Before long, this dispute was settled by Emperor Meiji's decision (the Izumo group was defeated), and Amaterasu Omikami's deification became the highest position.
It is said that the government recognized the possibility of the creation of a system of creed common to Shinto and that it was impossible to control the people directly by the Fukko Shinto theory.
Refer to the dispute about the enshrined deity of the Shinto ⁇  (the Office of Shinto ⁇ ) of Atsuta-jingu Shrine.
 ⁇  ⁇  used another name, 'Ohirumuchi,' when he made Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) appear in his novel.
This is because the term ' ⁇  Omikami' (the Sun Goddess) comes from the fact that the soshin ( ⁇  honored as god) appears in the text, which means the sun god or the natural god, and the sun god also uses the character '大日 ⁇ ' (Great Sun Goddess).
In fact, there is a description in the novel written by ⁇  that he couldn't get along with Shinsaku ⁇ , Shinpachi NAGAKURA, and ⁇ .
 ⁇  YASUOKA (1898-1983), who established Konkei Gakuin in 1926, said 'There is a belief in Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).'
Amaterasu Omikami is the ideal of the world with the spirit of Japan.
In this book, Izanami and Izanagi said, 'izana' (i.e., "izana" in Japanese), 'iza' (i.e., "izana" in Japanese) is the ideal of the world people to become pioneers, pioneers, and ⁇ s.'
Shrines dedicated to Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess)
Shrines that enshrine Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) are called ⁇ -jinja Shrines throughout the country, but the head shrine is Naiku (Kotai-jingu Shrine) (Kotai-jingu Shrine) of Ise-jingu Shrine.
Kotai-jingu Shrine enshrines Yata no Kagami (the eight-span mirror) as one of the Three Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family.
Most shrines throughout Japan enshrine the shinsatsu (called Jingu taima) of Kotai-jingu Shrine (Tensho Kotai-jingu Shrine).
Daimyo is a term derived from the daimyo (Japanese feudal lord).
It refers to a person who made a great name.
The term "tsui" refers to a small person.
Originally, it referred to a person who had power in the provinces.
In the samurai society, the word came to mean samurai who owned many shoryo (territory) and their subordinates.
In the Muromachi period, the Shugo (provincial constable) strengthened the control of the territory and became a Shugo daimyo (Japanese territorial lord as provincial constable).
In the Sengoku period (period of warring states), there appeared a large-sized feudal lord who established the control over their own territories, and they were called daimyobunkoku or Sengoku daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period).
In the Edo period, the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) gave the shoryo (territory) of more than 10,000 koku (approximately 1.8 million liters of crop yield) to the samurai families.
Of the samurai with less than 10,000 koku, samurai under the direct control of the bakufu were called jikisan.
In addition, daimyo (feudal lords) share the characteristics of the feudal lord with the lords of China, and therefore, they are treated as daimyo (Japanese feudal lords) instead of the lords.
This section describes mainly the early-modern daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) in the Edo period.
For the shugo daimyo (shugo, which were Japanese provincial military governors, that became daimyo, which were Japanese feudal lords) and Sengoku daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period), refer to this section.
Kodai-ji▁Temple
The hierarchy differed according to the social status, official rank, post, post, post, and rank.
First of all, due to the relationship with the Tokugawa Shogun family, the family was classified into gokamon (Tokugawa's relatives, shinpan daimyo), fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) who were mainly vassals of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara, and tozama daimyo (nonhereditary feudal lord) who became vassals of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara.
The first shogun, Ieyasu, instructed the Tokugawa shogunate to maintain the ⁇  lineage when the shogun family died, to watch daimyo throughout the country and to support the bakufu, established the Owari-Tokugawa family, and the Owari-Tokugawa family, and Yorifusa TOKUGAWA, the ninth son, was appointed to the Owari-Tokugawa family, Kishu-Tokugawa family, and Mito-Tokugawa clan.
In addition, Ieyasu appointed Hideyasu YUKI, who was the second Shogun Hidetada TOKUGAWA's older brother and the second son of Ieyasu, to the Echizen Domain, and established daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) of the Tokugawa clan throughout the country.
Furthermore, the hereditary vassals who laid the foundation of the Tokugawa Shogun family for generations were placed in the position of fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) as fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) and secured the military power of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) at the same time as Tairo (chief minister) and roju (member of shogun's council of elders) of the bakufu, and assisted the shogunate government.
The fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) whose kokudaka (a system for ⁇ ing land value for tribute purposes in the Edo period) was relatively low, and the fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) including the Torii clan, the ⁇ bara clan, the Honda clan, and the Ogasawara clan were relatively large, but in the Edo period, only fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) including the Sakai clan, the Abe clan, the Horita clan, the ⁇  clan, and the Toda clan were allowed to have more than ten thousand koku.
This became the reason for the separation of powers and military power.
After the Battle of Sekigahara, tozama daimyo (nonhereditary feudal lord) were subordinated to the Tokugawa family, and many families in the Battle of Sekigahara fought against the Tokugawa family.
Therefore, the bakufu's ⁇  was so strong that it actively engaged in ⁇  activities and was severely punished by ⁇  (forfeit rank of Samurai and properties) if there was a fear of ⁇  or rebellion.
Among the tozama daimyo (nonhereditary feudal lords), the Kaga Domain, which is famous as one of the 1000,000 koku of Kaga Province, the Sendai Domain, the Sendai Domain and the Kuroda clan, which had been a distinguished family since the Kamakura period, the branch family of the Asano clan, the branch domain of the Mori clan, the branch domain of the Mori clan, the Saga Domain, the Hosokawa clan, the Hosokawa clan, the Kumamoto Domain, the Tosa Domain, the Tosa Yamauchi clan, and the Akita Domain.
In addition, according to the status and social status of daimyo, those whose territory was more than one province or more, who had a castle, were called ⁇  daimyo ( ⁇  lord) or jinya (regional government office), and those whose castle was not located in the castle were called jinya (regional government office) and those whose rooms were located in Edo-jo Castle were classified according to their social status.
Refer to the section on ⁇ seki for details.
Daimyo (Japanese feudal lords) adopted the level of daimyo holding a domain, and the daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) with a fief of 100,000 koku (a unit of volume: rice 1-koku is 180.39 liter; a unit of volume: rice 1-koku is 180.39 liter, lumber 1-koku is 0.278 cubic meter) of ⁇  (a unit of volume: rice 1-koku is 180.39 liter, lumber 1-koku is 0.39 liter, lumber 1-koku is 0.278 cubic meter) had almost the same territory as the castle town area.
In the case of ⁇ , one village was divided and ruled by other feudal lords (sokyu).
Daimyo basically had more than 10,000 koku, but the ⁇  Domain of the ⁇  clan was 5,000 koku.
This is because the ⁇  clan was a descendant of the Ashikaga clan.
Daimyo were controlled by the bakufu according to the Buke ⁇  ( ⁇ s for the Military Houses) and the system of ⁇  (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo).
In addition, in the end of the Edo period, daimyo (feudal lords) were constantly suffering from economic difficulties because they were ordered to defend the coastal areas.

In " ⁇ yoshu" (a dictionary compiled in the Muromachi period) of the Muromachi period, two sounds of 'taimei' ( ⁇ ), 'daimyo' ( ⁇ ) and 'daimyo' ( ⁇ ) were used to mean ' ⁇ ' ( ⁇  lords) and 'senji' ( ⁇  wealthy).
In the Sengoku period (period of warring states), the distinction between 'taimei' and 'taimei' became ⁇  and was often called 'taimei.'
Two sounds of 'daimyo' and 'taimei' were also printed in the Japanese- ⁇  dictionary compiled in the early 17th century, but the distinction between the words was not clear and the two were regarded as major feudal lords.
It was from the end of the Heian period to the beginning of the Edo period that the word 'Daimyo' came to be used exclusively in the Kansei era.
