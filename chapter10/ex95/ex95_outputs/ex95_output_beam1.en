Umekoji Steam ⁇  Museum is a facility for ⁇  steam locomotives managed by West Japan Railway Company (JR West) in Kankiji-cho, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.
On October 10, 1972, the first facility to preserve steam locomotives, which were maintained by Japan National Railways, was opened to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Japan's opening of Japan National Railways, and it was the first facility to preserve them, positioned as a precious industrial cultural property and a valuable cultural property in Japan, and to preserve them.
JR West succeeded to JR West after the division and privatization of JNR in 1987.
This facility is a railway yard (Umekoji- ⁇  Operation Center) that is active in the past, and it is also conducted by the testing and testing of steam locomotives and ⁇ ing of D1010 diesel locomotives owned by the Japan National Railways and the Sagano Scenic Railway.
In the first place, this facility became the starting point of the development of steam locomotives rapidly from the late 1960s.
Initially, the ⁇  Ward, which was located in Oyama Station, Tochigi Prefecture, was the most likely candidate for the preservation district of the ⁇ , but it was decided that 'the area around the central part of Japan' and that Umekoji-ku Ward (the present-day Umekoji) was officially selected as a preservation district of preservation district in 1970.
Although the existing cars were generally considered to be the oldest existing cars (or the first one) in order to select the existing cars, some of them were not expected to preserve the cars at first, like C6262 model No.2.
The facility consists of "Rosen exhibition" which uses a fan-shaped structure and a ⁇  for transferring trains to Umekoji-ku Ward, and "Conquestions of materials" which were reconstructed and restored by the former Nijo Station building.
The ⁇ -type ⁇  was made of reinforced concrete built in 1914, and was designated as a national important cultural property along with the five- ⁇ ed ⁇ ed ceilings and a pullele.
In 2004, the construction of the Civil Engineering Society was selected for the Civil Engineering Heritage.
In 2006, the old Nijo Station ( ⁇  exhibition house), the Ogi-type train-car train-car train-car train, the one-car train-car train-car train-car train-car, and the repair equipment for repair were designated as the ⁇ -designated railway-- ⁇  railway.
The former Nijo Station building was built in 1904 by the Japan's oldest Japanese style building with two wooden ⁇ s, which was built by Kyoto Electric Railway as the head office building, and was built in Heian-jingu Shrine by consideration of the landscape.
Kyoto Railway was ⁇  in 1907 and subsequently used as a station for the JR ⁇  Station, and subsequently being used as a station for the JR ⁇  Station, but in 1996 the station was completed as a station house for the ⁇  of the Sanin Main Line ( ⁇  Line) and Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and in 1997, the station was moved and reconstructed in 1997, and the interior was reconstructed as a ⁇  for the ⁇  of the old building, and the interior was used as a ⁇  for the ⁇ .
It was designated as a cultural property by Kyoto City in April 1996.
18 model 118 steam locomotives manufactured from the Taisho period to the Showa period ( ⁇ ly, 174 locomotives were opened to the public) were housed and exhibited in the Ogigata ⁇ .
When the museum opened, there were a ⁇  of C5353-car trains and a C51-type C51-type steam locomotives, but later the number of cars for preservation was increased several times, and seven-car trains were preserved for the maintenance of the maintenance of the ⁇  maintenance.
Among them, five trains are registered with car registrations, and two types of trains (C57 type, C57 ⁇ ) are currently served on the main line, including the Yamaguchi Line, the ' ⁇  (train)' on the Yamaguchi Line, and the Hokuriku Main Line 'Kita- ⁇  (train)' on the Hokuriku Main Line.
Because the registration equipments other than these two cars are not ⁇ , no inspections are conducted in general, so the trains on the main line cannot be run on the main line.
Also, the 'SL team' train-cars' are operated on the rails within the library by the ⁇ s of the ⁇  equipment for the exhibition.
This display line was once running north from ⁇ -shako Depot to the north of the premises of large parking lot ( ⁇  facilities in the old building were once provided with a park), but the current Umekoji-koen Park was moved to the north of the premises of the old station building and was moved to the present-day Umekoji-koen Park.
Even today, it has functions as an institution, and is connected with the operation lines.
After the Takatori factory of West Japan Railway Company closed, steam locomotives were also improved.

Shomyo is one of the traditional Japanese music.
It is a religious music that is used for rites and festivals in the broad sense.
It is also called Bonbai or Bonku in Japan.
In the old ⁇ , it is written as  ⁇  in hiragana (the Japanese syllabary).
It is one of the gakumonjo (the five classics) (Gomyo or gomyo) fields of the Kegon sect.
Gomyo refers to five subjects of Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s), ⁇  ( ⁇ s of Philosophy, Monpo ( ⁇ s of Literature, ⁇  and Technology), Myobo (study of law), Inmyo ( ⁇ s of medicine), Naimyo ( ⁇ s of the ethics of the nature of the law), and Naimyo ( ⁇ s of Buddhism) ( ⁇ s of the teachings of Buddha).
It was introduced into Japan along with Buddhism.
There is a record that a Buddhist memorial service was held in ⁇  when the Great Buddha of Todai-ji Temple was held, and it is thought that Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) was actively performed in the Nara period.
In the early Heian period, Saicho and Kukai each introduced Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) and the basis of Tendai Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) and Shingon Shomyo (chanting of Shingon Buddhism).
Even in the Buddhist sects other than the Tendai sect and Shingon sect, each sect has their own Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) and is still inherited.
Since Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ ) passed down in oral teachings, no corrections were made.
Therefore, ⁇  was extremely difficult.
Later, hakase (master of astronomy) was invented as a doctor of astronomy.
Also, depending on the schools, it is not ⁇  to specialized terms such as hakase.
However, hakase is a reference to recite Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) and if they learn Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s), they are required to teach them, and they cannot maintain and inherit the school from their master to disciples.
Therefore, the development of leaders and successors was essential.
As various conditions were emphasized, many schools disappeared.
The Tendai Shomyo (chanting of Tendai Shomyo) brought to Japan by Saicho, and developed its own way.
After Saicho, Ennin and Annen flourished.
It is known as the ⁇  of the ⁇  of the ⁇  family.
In ⁇ , ⁇  built ⁇ -in Temple ( ⁇  Ward, Kyoto City) in Ohara, Kyoto.
He was given the name of Mt. ⁇ -in Temple in Ohara and named Mt. Gyozan, which was modeled after the Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) of China, and was named Mt. Gyozan.
Later, two temples of ⁇ -in Temple and ⁇ -in Temple became known as Dojo of Ohara-ryu Ugyozan Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant).
Later, Jakugen formed a group and in Ohara there was a statement of Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) of the two schools.
Later, ⁇  revived Ohara Shomyo (chanting of Ohara).
Tanchi developed the trend based on the new music theory.
Since then, he has held the central role in Tendai Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s of Tendai Shomyo Nenbutsu) and has been inherited by the present Tendai Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s).
The Shomyo Nenbutsu sect, Jodo sect, Jodo Shinshu sect, and Jodo Shinshu sect are the lineages of Tendai Shomyo.
The Shingon Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) of Shingon Buddhism was based on Kukai's ⁇ , and it is not known.
It was after the mid-Edo period that Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ ) was ⁇ .
 ⁇  was especially known as the ⁇  of the restoration.
He worked hard to compose and improve Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ ).
There were many schools until the Kamakura period, but it was divided into four groups (Honsoin-ryu, Shinso-in-ryu, Daigo-ryu, Daigo-ryu, and Nakagawa-daishin-ryu).
The Shomyo of the Kogi Shingon sect declined and disappeared during the Edo period.
The original, the ⁇ in-ryu, the Shingi-in-ryu and the Daigo-ryu schools were abolished in the early Meiji period.
Currently, it is divided into Chizan Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) (Kyoto/ ⁇ -ji Temple), Buzan Shomyo ( ⁇ s of Buddhist ⁇ s), Nanzanshin-ryu School ( ⁇ -dera Temple, Mt. Koya, Koyasan Shingon Sect temples) and Kogi Shingon Sect.
The Shomyo Nenbutsu (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) of the Shingon sect Chizan school and the Shingon sect ⁇  school of Shingon Buddhism are derived from the Nakagawa school.
Raiyu ⁇  the Daigo school.
In 1583, when the Battle of Shizugatake ( ⁇  Prefecture) was burnt down by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI, the Negoro-ji Temple in Mt. Chisan and Mt. Toyoyama fell into decline, and the Tachikawa-ryu school was formed based on the old school of Daigo.
The characteristics of this book are 'rongi' ( ⁇ ) and 'shomyo' (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ ) of Mt. ⁇ .
The origin of the Nanzan Shinryu school (Kogi Shingon sect lineage Shomyo) was the original school of the Nakagawa school.
The Nakagawa Oshin school was founded by the Daidoji school in Nara Prefecture.
During the Teiei era (1232 - ⁇ ), the ⁇  of Mt. Koya and Sanbo-in Temple moved their base to Mt. Koya.
Later, he was given the name Nanzan-ryu school, which was later called Nanzan-ryu school.
He was the founder of the ⁇  school and the Noshin school.
The music of the music of the ⁇  such as Heikyoku ( ⁇ - ⁇ ), Yokyoku (Noh song), ⁇  (Noh song), Joruri ( ⁇  narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment), Joruri ( ⁇  narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment) and Joruri ( ⁇  narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment) can be said to have changed the ⁇  of Shomyo.
It greatly influenced the music of ⁇ .

According to Nihonshoki, Emperor Tenchi had his first son, Prince Otomo succeed to the throne.
However, his younger brother, Prince Oama (Emperor Tenmu) was enthroned after the Jinshin War, and he was enthroned after the death of Emperor Tenchi.
After that, Emperor Shotoku of the line of Emperor Tenmu was enthroned.
After the death of Emperor Shoko, his grandson, ⁇  no okimi, was enthroned as Emperor Konin, and after that, the line of Emperor Tenchi became the line of Emperor Tenchi.
It is said that he sent four daughters to Prince Oama as his wife because he was ⁇  by Prince Oama and sent to Nukata no Okimi as his wife.
Brief Personal▁History
626: He was born.
The Emperor was formally installed as Crown Prince on July 12, ⁇ .
Saimei/Seimei July 24, 661, ⁇ : Shosei (a title of respect given to close female relatives of the Emperor or a woman of comparable standing)
On February 20, 678, the Emperor ⁇  ascended the throne.
On January 7, 672, he died at the age of 46.
(There is a theory that says 'There is a theory that says he died of illness after the death of Emperor Keiko, and he was killed in the mountains of Mt. Sanryo, because he was killed by the Emperor Tenmu because he was killed in the mountain where he was killed by the Emperor Tenmu, because he was ⁇  by the Emperor ⁇ .)
It is one of the ⁇ s of political history in the political history of the late seventh century that Emperor Tenchi did not ascend to the throne for a long time.
There are several views on this matter.
Emperor Tenmu intended to strengthen his power.
In other words, it is considered that Emperor Tenmu was an established theory, and it is incorrect to say that Emperor Tenchi was a prince born before Emperor Jomei married Emperor Jomei, and he was a different father of Emperor Tenchi.
In fact, if the year of his birth is correct, the year of Emperor Tenmu is counted as the longest year, based on the age of Emperor Tenmu in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) and some historical books, the year of Emperor Tenmu was counted as the year of his birth.
However, there are many historical materials that do not have contradictions between the same historical materials, and there are many historical materials that describe the age of eight to nine.
In response, there is a thesis that 'if my father is a younger brother,' ' ⁇ , I will take my older brother's age,' but it is said that the age of Emperor Tenchi was ⁇ , and the age of sixteen was ⁇  in the 'Nihonshoki' (Chronicles of Japan), and the age of sixteen was passed away when the father of Emperor Jomei was enthroned.
Therefore, the year of birth of this book was six years after the introduction of the Honcho koin jounroku (the Emperor's family tree).
The Emperor ⁇  opposed the " ⁇ " and insisted that the Emperor Tenchi and the Emperor ⁇ , who were not unusual in ancient times, did not have a Shosei system, and did not ascend to the throne immediately.
(The difference in the error was that the error occurred for the purpose of the incident.)
Some people argue that the same is not ⁇  because the history books which were compiled in different periods, such as the counterargument of "Nihonshoki" and the other books which are pointed out as 'Nihonshoki' are different from the period of the compilation.
(Refer to the section on 'Emperor Tenmu's age')
The theory is that Prince Karu was driven out of his position because he was a coup d' ⁇  by Karu no Miko (Emperor Kotoku) and was forced to ⁇  his position.
Recently, it has been pointed out that the relationship between Prince Naka no Oe and Prince Yamashiro no Oe was relatively good, and that the basic policy of the Emperor was similar to that of the Emperor.
In this way, Naka no Oe no Oji ⁇  Iruka's murder.
In addition, the description in the Taika Reforms in Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan) was recognized, so this theory was advocated.
In this theory, the following facts are also attracted to the attention: the reason why Emperor Kogyoku abdicated the throne and the Soga clan other than Iruka was exiled even after the coup d' ⁇ , and the other reasons are not explained.
There is a theory that the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi was caused by opposition from the female relationship of Emperor Tenchi.
This is because the poems which Emperor Kotoku presented to his wife, the Imperial Princess (the daughter of Emperor Tenchi) in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) were reflected in the ⁇  relationship between her and Emperor Tenchi.
Although the love and marriage of the sister of SOGA no Iruka were allowed, the ⁇  of the ⁇  was in fact a love affair among the sisters of SOGA no Iruka at that time, and the ⁇  of the ⁇  was in fact involved in the relationship of the Emperor ⁇ , who was persuaded by his uncle, Karu no ookimi (Emperor Kotoku), and he was ⁇  by the ⁇  of the relationship even after the assassination of his uncle Karu no Okimi.
Although it is said that after the death of Empress Saimei, she succeeded to the Imperial Throne as the consort of the previous emperor, but there are some theories about her being ⁇ ed due to some reasons.
This is based on the theory that the person whose name was 'Naka no Mikoto' was written in "Manyoshu" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) was ⁇  no Himemiko, and that 'Naka no Mikoto' could be interpreted as the Emperor who succeeded to the throne from Emperor Tenchi until Emperor Tenchi was enthroned.
If ⁇  no Himemiko was 'the Imperial Princess' (the Emperor's order) and 'the Empress' (the Empress Teimei) was 'the Emperor', it is thought that she was called by such a special naming, but there is no doubt that she was Empress Saimei.
Although it is difficult to prove that the history of politics and historical materials are based on the nature of politics, the research has been progressing in future development, including cooperation with the results of the results.
▁Poems
He was also a poet of four of his poems in the Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).
In Ogura Hyakunin Isshu (the Ogura Anthology of One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Poets), the following poems are included in the following poem:
The autumn field of autumn leaves, I'll ⁇  the ⁇  of my sleeves, but I'm ⁇ ing my sleeves.
He was one of the following poems in Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).
Mt. ⁇  ⁇ s the old ⁇  that would be ⁇ ed from the age of the gods, and that of the ⁇ s and the ⁇ s of the ⁇ s will be the only thing to be ⁇ .
The Saionji family (the Kanin line) was a court noble descended from the Fujiwara clan.
He was a member of the House of Fujiwara clan and his social standing was the Seiga family (one of the highest court noble families in Japan at that time).
The ⁇  and Imadegawa families (Kikutei family) were branch families of the Saionji family.
There is also a family of Saionji in Iyo Province, who used the surname Saionji, as a powerful branch of the Saionji family.
The family crest was Sanmitsudomoe.
The Saionji family was founded by FUJIWARA no Michisue, the third son of FUJIWARA no ⁇ .
When the great-grandson of Michisue, MINAMOTO no Yoritomo, was confined to the Imperial Court as a ⁇  of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) when he was suspected of having been a niece of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo, he was confined in the Jokyu War, and after the war, he gained the confidence of the Kamakura bakufu, and he gained the real power of the Imperial Court as a ⁇  (grand minister of state) and rose to the position of Daijo daijin (Grand minister of state).
Saionji's family name was changed to ⁇ -ji Temple, which was the second villa in Kyoto (Kitasozanso, Kadono County, Yamashiro Province).
This hall was also called Kitayamadono Palace, and the current Kinkaku-ji Temple was built by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA by the Saionji family.
After Kintsune's death, he supported the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) and had a power to support the Sekke (line of regents and advisers) through the Kamakura period.
 ⁇  SAIONJI married Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama), and had his daughter marry the Cloistered Emperor Kameyama and Emperor Godaigo.
However, after his son, Kinhira SAIONJI, who had been his son, decided to distance from the Imperial Court by the bakufu, the Daikakuji Imperial line was then forced to ⁇  with the Jimyoin Imperial line, and deepened confrontation with the Daikakuji Imperial line.
Later, during the time of Kinmune SAIONJI, the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) fell and the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) was involved in the ⁇  Incident.
Kinmune ⁇  the remnants of the Hojo clan, and assassinated ⁇  HOJO (Tokioki), who started the Kenmu Restoration, and planned to rebel against the Retired Emperor Gofushimi, who was the Retired Emperor Gofushimi of Jimyoin-to (imperial lineage from Emperor Gofukakusa to Emperor Gokomatsu), and the plan to ⁇  Kinshige SAIONJI's plan was arrested and executed.
During the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, ⁇  SAIONJI, the son of Kinmune, served the Northern Court (Japan) and became Udaijin (Minister of the Right), and restored the family name.
During the Muromachi and Edo periods, the family business was established as a family business for biwa (Japanese lute).
In the early Edo period, ⁇  SAIONJI married Tadataka HOSOKAWA (later disinherited) who was the eldest legitimate son of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA, and ⁇  ⁇ , the first daughter of Kyumu ⁇ , to the position of ⁇  (Minister of the Center), but ⁇  ⁇  ⁇  ⁇  the Saionji family to give 600 koku (according to the "Koshitsukoroku").
Kinmochi SAIONJI was adopted from the Rikken ⁇  ( ⁇ al of Constitutional Government) at the end of the Edo period, and after the Meiji Restoration he was active as a politician, he was active in the political world as a Genro ( ⁇  statesman) and was highly influential in the Taisho period and Showa period.
Incidentally, Kinmochi was in trouble with the biwa (Japanese lute) of the Saionji family, which was a family business, but during his term of prime minister, he was said to have been ⁇  by Emperor Meiji for his bad luck, ' ⁇  the Saionji family was ⁇  to hear the biwa' and he was forced to ⁇  eight times to receive the biwa (Japanese lute) of the Imperial Household Ministry and biwa (Japanese lute) of the Imperial Household Ministry.

It is written in "Sei ShonagonMakura no Soshi" (The Pillow Book) that he entered a box with gold leaf and had a gold- ⁇  box.
It is designated as an Important Cultural Property.
It is considered to be the oldest among the manuscripts of "Makura no Soshi" (The Pillow Book) in the ⁇ -in manuscript.
Among them, the Sakai-bon manuscript, which was compiled by the Sakai-bon line, was divided into two volumes in " ⁇  ⁇ " (Collection of historical documents compiled by Hokiichi ⁇ ), and the Sakai-bon manuscript was included in "Shin ⁇  ⁇  ⁇ " (New Classified Documents).
Also, Noinbon was used as an original text for old type printing in the early Edo period, and it was used as a set of commentaries such as "Makura no Soshi ⁇ " (the Pillow Book) and "Makura no Soshi Shunsho" (the Pillow Book) (by Suemura ⁇ ) and " ⁇  Shunsho" ( ⁇  Notes of the Pillow Book).
However, in 1946, the second edition of the three-volume edition was re- ⁇  by Jutaro TANAKA (1917 - 1987), and after the World War II, the text was mostly published and was used for textbooks.
In any case, it is considered that the text of the Tale of Genji uses three-volume book, and the picture scroll of "Makura no Soshi ⁇ " (picture scroll of the Pillow Book) which was completed in the late Kamakura period, is still extant.
The second edition of the third volume has a separate chapter of more than 300 chapters.
It consists of 'Ruijushodan' ( ⁇  chapter) which depicts 'Museba' (S ⁇ s of the Lotus Sutra) and 'Suzure no hana' (The Flowering Flowers), 'Suzure no hana' (The ⁇  Flowers of the Cherry ⁇ s), ' ⁇ ' (The ⁇ s of the ⁇ s), ' ⁇ ' (The ⁇ s of the ⁇ s), ' ⁇ ' (The ⁇ s of the ⁇ s), ' ⁇ ' (The ⁇ s of the Past), ' ⁇ ' (The ⁇ s of the Present), ' ⁇ ' (The ⁇ s ⁇ s of the Past), ' ⁇ ' (The ⁇ s of the Present), ' ⁇ ' (The ⁇ s ⁇ s ⁇ s ⁇ s) and ' ⁇ ' (The ⁇ s ⁇ s ⁇ s ⁇ s) which are the ' ⁇ ' ( ⁇ s), and ' ⁇ ' ( ⁇ ssings ⁇ s ⁇ s), and ' ⁇ s
However, there are some ⁇  chapters (for example, 'Haruka' ( ⁇ ) chapter 1 is different in common with the following:
It is written in a simple language style using a Japanese writing style, and many of the ⁇ s are ⁇ , but reflecting the ⁇  of the decline of the Nakanokanpaku family and the ⁇  of the lord Teishi/Sadako, it is also exposed to the ⁇  of the ⁇  wounds.
The sophisticated ⁇  of the author and the sharp observation of the ⁇  of the "Genji Monogatari" were combined, and the ⁇  of the ' ⁇ ' of "Genji Monogatari" (The Tale of Genji) was inspired by the ' ⁇ ' beauty of the ' ⁇ ' world.
Respectful▁evaluation
The Pillow Book was created and formed as a beauty of polygage ( ⁇  of ⁇ ) in various fields because it was deeply loved by human beings and nature.
The following is a ⁇  of the ⁇  of the ⁇  that is associated with each other: In the following chapter, the ⁇  of the ⁇  is ⁇ , the ⁇  of the ⁇ , the ⁇ , and the ⁇  of the ⁇ , the ⁇  of the ⁇  is ⁇  with the expression of the weather, the weather is ⁇ ly expressed by the expression of the weather.
The expression of ' ⁇  - ⁇ ' ( ⁇  in spring) ( ⁇  in spring, etc.) is a ⁇  war ( ⁇ ) which was a ⁇  of the ⁇  of the readers who were familiar with waka (Japanese poem) and were ⁇  to the ⁇  of the ⁇  of the readers who were familiar with the traditional Japanese poetry tradition.
It is a ⁇  of the ⁇  of Chugu Teishi.
It was written in order to calm the soul of Teishi, who died while the Michitaka family fell into decline, during the ⁇  of the ⁇  of the Michitaka's family.
Therefore, it is natural to say that the decline of the Michitaka family was not described (this is the same).
The chapter of the chapter on the Tale of Genji, which ⁇ s the ⁇  of the Emperor's favor, is also in the era when people who ⁇  the Empress (FUJIWARA no Shoshi) and chugu (the second consort of an emperor) are disappointed, but they think that they live in the world of love and good fortune ( ⁇ ri) because of their favor.
Evaluation of<unk>
It is a ⁇  that the ⁇  of the ⁇ -sama (the ⁇  of the ⁇  family) tried to ⁇  Sei Shonagon's rank and to ⁇ e the ⁇  (the ⁇  of Confucius) (by ⁇ ).
(It is not ⁇  to say that the social status of the family was high, not only for the family of his own relatives but also for those who were not in the social status.)
It is known that 'the record of civilization and enlightenment of Teishi' was not written by ' ⁇ ' ( ⁇ tsugu ISHIDA).
Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA was the 15th Seii Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) (reigned from December 5, 1866 to December 9, 1867).
He was the only shogun who did not attend the service as Shogun in Edo-jo Castle.
He was Naidaijin (Minister of the Center) and Juichii (Junior First Rank) the First Order of Merit.
He was a member of Kizokuin (the House of Peers).
After the death of Iemochi TOKUGAWA, the 14th Shogun, who acted as guardian for Shogun's guardianship, he assumed the post of the 15th Shogun of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
After the Meiji Restoration, he aimed to return the government to the Imperial Court ( ⁇  Taisei Hokan), but in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi after the Restoration of Imperial Rule, he was ordered to return to Edo-jo Castle from Edo-jo Castle and ordered to kill the enemy by the Imperial Court, and he was ordered to surrender Edo-jo Castle without blood.
When he was suspended from home during the Meiji period, he devoted himself to his ⁇  and lived until the Taisho period as a prince.
Yoshinobu' is also read as 'Yoshinonobu' or 'Keiki' as his common name.
There is a record in the official documents of the Edo bakufu, 'Yoshihisa,' in the documents of the shogun during his tenure.
There are still other expressions of 'Yen' in the English newspaper and 'Yen' in English.
Although he is often called 'Yoshinobu' in Mito City where he was born, he is often called 'Keiki' in the ⁇  of his remaining life.
According to the person who knows Yoshinobu in his lifetime, Yoshinobu himself was fond of the 'Keiki-sama' ( ⁇ ) and he also called himself 'Keiki' ( ⁇ ) because he was ⁇  to his younger brother Akitabu TOKUGAWA.
It is said that Yoshinobu's successor, ⁇  TOKUGAWA, was also called 'Keikyu-sama' ( ⁇ ) by people around him like Yoshinobu.
Although two names of 'Keiki-sama' and 'Keiki-san' can be confirmed, it is thought that the term 'Keiki-san' is rarely used in many places in Shizuoka Prefecture, and even in Shizuoka Prefecture, it is often used for both of them.
Although the word "Keiki" is often used in the family line of people involved in the revolt of the Higo Domain, it is possible that the use of the family was ⁇ ly ⁇  in the ⁇ -shikimoku because the use of the people involved in the Higo Domain who were engaged in overthrowing the Shogunate.
On October 29, ⁇ , he was born as the seventh son of the ninth lord of Mito Domain, ⁇ , in Edo, and was born as the seventh son of the ninth lord of the Mito Domain, Nariaki TOKUGAWA.
His mother was Princess Yoshiko (Yoshiko) who became the legal wife of Iemitsu TOKUGAWA, the third Shogun, and he made his real mother become the Shogun.
However, Iemitsu's real mother was Oe no kata, the legal wife of Hidetada, the legal wife of Kasuga no Tsubone, but some say that Kasuga no Tsubone was the real mother of Kasuga no Tsubone.
His childhood name was ⁇ maro.
He taught the education policy of Nariaki TOKUGAWA, ' ⁇  a son is raised by the nation,' and after seven months, he moved to Mito Domain, and many of his students were taught in the ⁇  of the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family, and taught studies and martial arts from Seisai EIZAWA and others.
It seems that Yoshinobu was ⁇  at that time, and at first, Nariaki was adopted into another family, and he thought that he should keep his ⁇  as a ⁇  for his eldest son, ⁇  TOKUGAWA.
On September 1, ⁇ , the order of ⁇ maro to Mito Domain was issued by the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) to succeed the Hitotsubashi family.
 ⁇ maro was given the name Yoshinobu on September 1 and given the character of his name from the 12th Shogun Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA in December, and was given the name Yoshinobu.
Ieyoshi often visited Hitotsubashi mansion to ask Yoshinobu as the candidate for heir to the Shogun, but he gave up receiving advice from roju (member of shogun's council of elders) Masahiro ABE, who was roju (member of shogun's council of elders).
In 1853, Ieyoshi died of illness during the confusion in the ⁇  of the Black Ships, and Iesada TOKUGAWA, the 13th Shogun, who succeeded Ieyoshi, was sickly and ⁇  to his son, ⁇ , ' ⁇  to choose the heir to the Shogun' (the issue of the Shogun's heir).
The Hitotsubashi group, including Nariaki TOKUGAWA, ⁇  ABE, the lord of Satsuma Domain, and Nariaki TOKUGAWA, the lord of the domain, and the ⁇  group of the O-oku group, which was the residence of Naosuke II, the lord of the Kishu Domain, Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA, and the biological mother of Iesada and Honjuin.
The Hitotsubashi group tried to put Tenshoin, an adopted daughter of Nariakira SHIMAZU, into O-oku (the inner halls of Edo Castle where the wife of the Shogun and her servants reside) as the Shogun's wife and the Shogun's wife, but after Masahiro ABE and Nariakira SHIMAZU died one after another, the Tairo (chief minister) Naosuke II, who became Tairo (chief minister) died in 1858, ⁇ ed the decision of ' ⁇  of the heir of Shogun, Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA.'
In the same year, Naosuke II signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan without imperial sanction.
Yoshinobu ⁇ ed Nariaki, the lord of Fukui Domain, ⁇  MATSUDAIRA, and others to the ⁇  of the ⁇ , but he was ⁇  of the ⁇  of the ⁇ , and in 1859, he was suspended from office (An Ansei no Taigoku [ ⁇  of ⁇  by the Shogunate]).
Yoshinobu himself was not ⁇  to become heir to the Shogun, but sent a letter to Nariaki saying 'I don't want to do it, but I have to do so because I have failed to do so since I am killed himself.'
In 1860, he was suspended from office.
In 1862, Imperial envoy ⁇  ⁇ , a guard of Satsuma Domain led by Hisamitsu SHIMAZU, entered Edo and issued an imperial order to Emperor Komei, saying ' ⁇  TOKUGAWA should appoint Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA as Shogun's guardian and appoint him as Tairo (chief minister).'
On July 6, the bakufu appointed Yoshinobu as the guardian of the shogun, and ⁇  to the post of Seiji Sosai ( ⁇  President of political affairs).
Yoshinobu and ⁇  ⁇  carried out reforms in the Bunkyu Reform called Bunkyu Reform, and established Kyoto ⁇  (Military governor of Kyoto) and ⁇  (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo) to ⁇  the ⁇  system.
In 1863, he went to Kyoto as a ⁇  of Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA, and he made a ⁇  effort to negotiate with the Imperial Court to expel foreigners.
When Emperor Komei visited Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine to pray for expulsion of foreigners, he was ordered to carry out a sword by the Emperor to carry out expulsion of foreigners, and he ordered Iemochi to have an audience with him, saying ' ⁇ ' ( ⁇  illness) and ' ⁇ ' ( ⁇  illness).
When the Sonno Joi ha (supporters of the doctrine of restoring the emperor and expelling the barbarians) led by Choshu Domain was expelled from Kyoto in the Coup of August 18 (old calendar), he went to Kyoto again to participate in the Sanyo-kaigi ( ⁇  of imperial court and shogunate) by the Kobu- ⁇  ( ⁇  of the imperial court and the shogunate) and the Shogunate.
However, the conference was considered as a ⁇ , and he made a plan to stop the government by ⁇ ing the ⁇  of the Imperial Prince Kuninomiya ⁇  with his late intention, ⁇ ing ⁇ -jo Castle, ⁇ -jo Castle, ⁇ -jo Castle, and ⁇ -jo Castle, and furthermore, he tried to ⁇  the ⁇  of the system by saying 'I have been ⁇  by Shimazu's forces,' and furthermore, he also persuaded Nakagawa no Miya to ⁇  the system.
After that, he was appointed as Kinri Goshuei Sotoku (Governor-General of the Imperial Palace Guard) by the Imperial Court in Kyoto, and was a ⁇  of the Emperor and court nobles along with ⁇  ( ⁇  of the Aizu clan) Katamori MATSUDAIRA, ⁇  MATSUDAIRA (lord of Aizu Domain), and Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA (the lord of Kuwana Domain).
In the Tenguto no Ran ( ⁇  of Tenguto), he showed his coolness to cut down the vassals of his parents and Mito Domain, including ⁇ sai TAKEDA, who supported Yoshinobu.
In 1864, he was attacked by the army of bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) at the Kinmon Incident, and attacked the Choshu army which occupied Takatsukasa residence.
After this, he was involved in the conquest of Choshu, and made efforts to make Imperial sanctions for the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan, and succeeded in obtaining imperial sanctions on condition.
In the second conquest of Choshu in 1866, Yoshinobu received an imperial order to attack Choshu by suppressing the Satsuma Domain.
However, the bakufu's forces refused to dispatch troops to Satsuma, which had a connection with the Satsuma clan, and the bakufu army was defeated.
On August 20, during the second Choshu Conquest, Iemochi died in Osaka-jo Castle.
Yoshinobu took the Imperial Court's movement to launch an imperial rescript on the ⁇  of the ⁇  battle and concluded a peace agreement.
Although Iemochi was recommended to succeed Iemochi, Yoshinobu refused this proposal.
On August 20, the Tokugawa Shogun family inherited the position of Shogun, but the Shogun's assumption of the shogunate post continued to be refused.
Later, roju (member of shogun's council of elders) and others asked the shogun to go to the castle, but they refused and on December 5, they were appointed Shogun by the Emperor (from the Emperor Komei).
This was because he was in a form of favor and became a shogun, and he was ⁇  to take advantage of politics.
Yoshinobu received the assistance of the French minister Leon Rohur, ⁇ ing the relief of 20,000 dollars from France, established the ⁇  ⁇ sho ( ⁇  Institute) and the Shusensho ( ⁇  Shipbuilding) and the Shushujo ( ⁇  Shipbuilding) and implemented military reforms, including Jurrene Brenes Brenes.
Also, he encouraged his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA to study in Europe, where he sent his own younger brother Akitake to Paris.
At the problem of opening Hyogo port, he insisted on the Imperial Court to open the port and obtained permission.
Yoshinobu, who had been ⁇  to 'the secret imperial command to attack the shogunate' to the Satsuma and Choshu clans, reported to the Imperial Court on October 14, 1867 and issued an imperial sanction ( ⁇  Taisei Hokan) on the following day.
It is said that the Imperial Court at that time had no administrative ability, and it was said that the Tokugawa shogunate was trying to maintain the Tokugawa government by leading the council of feudal lords.
However, Toshimichi OKUBO and Tomomi IWAKURA, who aimed to overthrow the Shogunate, issued a ⁇  in December, and Yoshinobu ordered to 'Jikan nochi' (resignation of resignation of Naidaijin and ⁇  of Tokugawa's territory) to be ordered by Yoshinobu.
Yoshinobu left Osaka-jo Castle to avoid conflict, and he advocated the Tokugawa ⁇  (three privileged branches of Tokugawa family) by gathering ministers from foreign countries and others, and furthermore, he made a movement to ⁇ e Tokugawa's ⁇  and gave him permission to change the Jikan nochi (an application for resignation) to the Imperial Court.
However, in the following year, 1868, the Satsuma Domain raised an army with the support of the Satsuma clan, and he was ordered to go to Kyoto using Aizu and Kuwana Domain soldiers.
However, the former Shogunate forces were still in a ⁇  position in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi and the Battle of Toba-Fushimi on January 3, and they were forced to retreat to Edo in "Kaiyo Maru War" (Kaiyo Maru Warship) with military forces.
Soon after, the imperial army, which had Yoshinobu as the enemy of the Imperial Court, went down to the east, and the Imperial army, which was led by Dai Sotoku (Governor-General of the Dazai-fu offices), was led by the Great Governor General, Imperial Prince ⁇ .
Yoshinobu insisted on ⁇ ing allegiance to the resistance force by ⁇  ⁇ .
In February, he made a decision to ⁇  Kaishu KATSU and himself was ordered to be placed under house arrest in Daijiin of Ueno Kanei-ji Temple.
And the head of the Tokugawa family, Kamenosuke TAYASU (later Tatsunosuke TOKUGAWA) was adopted as his adopted son.

Even after Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor), he was the most famous person among the masters of ⁇ -jutsu (art of warfare) and was taught to him every day.
He did not sleep well, and when his father, Ienari, was sleeping with his bedside when he was sleeping, he tried to ⁇ e the ⁇  ( ⁇  threatening) to ⁇ e the Tokugawa family, he was ⁇  to sleep (It is said that he was ⁇  and ⁇  when he was actually ⁇ , he was ⁇ ed by his sword).
On the other hand, there is an anecdote that when he was ⁇ , he was ⁇  with the two men, his wife and his mistress, to become 'Y' as a measure to assassinate the Emperor, and that he was ⁇  with the Chinese character 'Y' in the name of his wife's name.

He was watching Ieyasu again.'
Ryoma SAKAMOTO, who decided to make a decision to restore the political power of the Imperial rule, ⁇  that 'Oju (Shogun) is the most loyal person today.
Even if you are ⁇ , you will be ⁇  to you, but you will be ⁇ .
He gave a review to Yoshinobu, 'I will abandon his life for the public' and tried to give him the position of vice chief adviser to the new government.
However, it was in the Meiji period that Yoshinobu knew the existence of Ryoma ( ⁇  Ryoma) himself.
There is no story that Yoshinobu was allowed to do so, and Ryoma's ⁇  of his life is very much more ⁇  than the aftermath of the Meiji Restoration.
He was ⁇  by his enemy, saying ' ⁇  the enemy's escape to Edo after he was defeated in the Battle of Okehazama.
At this time, although the seal of Kinogi ( ⁇  fans) had been handed down since Ieyasu, ⁇  was accompanied by ⁇ , and there were some who ⁇  the ⁇  of Yoshinobu's ⁇ .
However, there is a theory that the situation was not necessary to resist armed uprisings in Edo and Musashi Provinces, and that Yoshinobu ⁇  from Osaka-jo Castle because he became an enemy of the Emperor, and that the long-term battle was necessary to prevent intervention of foreign countries by foreign countries.
It is said that he was ⁇  to be an enemy of the new government because he was ordered by the Emperor, or because he was confined to Kanei-ji Temple, or because he was in charge of the Imperial Court, he was ⁇  to the Emperor or the Imperial Court (Mitogaku, or Mitogaku, which was a thought of reverence for the Emperor and the Imperial Court), but he was also said to have been ⁇  by his lord, and he did not have a ⁇  to deal with the enemy.
Because the Meiji Restoration was forced to change its political power in the form of a modern state due to the ⁇  of allegiance and surrender of Edo without bloodshed, the modern Japanese independence was highly evaluated.
 ⁇  ⁇  was a retainer who was employed during the time of the head of the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family, and after the Meiji Restoration, he was not allowed to use it.

He was so ⁇  that he was ⁇  for his ⁇ , and he ⁇ ed his character and the character of his mind, ' ⁇  don't like anything else' and ' ⁇ masa was a person who was ⁇ .'
Based on these materials, the completed work after Yoshinobu's death is " ⁇  Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA Koki" (Diary of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA).
When he was pardoned, Yoshinobu expressed his will to express his gratitude to the Emperor Meiji, who was the highest rank of the peerage, and therefore, he told him to ⁇  his funeral ceremony not to Buddha, but to ⁇  him with Shinto rituals.
Therefore, the grave of Yoshinobu was not in the graveyard of the Tokugawa family, the ⁇  of the Tokugawa family, which was the family temple of the Tokugawa family, but a round ⁇  with the same ⁇  as the Imperial family in Taninaka-en Garden.
This was because the mausoleum of Emperor Komei was ⁇  to be a ⁇ , ("Kogaigawa Yoshinobu ⁇  den" [Diary of Yoshinobu ⁇ ]).
Katsukiyo ⁇ , roju (member of shogun's council of elders) at that time, described that Yoshinobu had no intention of ⁇ ing his life to his life, and that he would be ⁇  to his life without worrying about the ⁇  of his life, and later, he said, 'he should be ⁇  to act together with Yoshinobu.'
There was a ⁇  image in ' ⁇ mae' ( ⁇  of the enemy's ⁇ ) in the Battle of Nagashino, but after Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor), it was ⁇  to reconstruct new ⁇ , and there are some attempts to re ⁇  the new ⁇  of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA (NHK Historical Drama) in recent years.
Like his father Nariaki, pork in Satsuma Domain was fond of this dish and was called ⁇  Ichisama ( ⁇ -sama, pork and pork were fond of ⁇ -sama).

He is famous as a ⁇ man, but he seems to have been unable to take a ⁇  technique.
He often wrote many magazines in the ⁇  magazine but it is said that he did not have much been adopted.
His great-grandson, ⁇  TOKUGAWA, was also freed, and his photograph taken by Yoshinobu was found in the house of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA, including the photograph taken by Yoshinobu, and he was ⁇  and edited and edited.
His younger brother Akitatake TOKUGAWA was a friend of such ⁇ .

▁Note
Nara Line is a railway ( ⁇ ) railway ( ⁇ ) operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West) from Kizu Station (Kyoto Prefecture) of the Nara Electric Railway to Kyoto Station on the Uji Line of the Kyoto Dento, which is operated by the West Japan Railway Company (JR West).
The entire line is included in the suburbs of the metropolitan area.
Because the station's terminal station is a terminal for the Kansai Main Line, the official starting point is Kizu Station, but the train bound for Kizu Station is down-bound (the number of trains is odd), and the reverse train is an inbound train (the number of trains is odd).
Except for the following data, the following are described in the direction of Kizu from Kyoto to Kizu.
The reason why the selection is made to be green, and the reason for selecting the selection is that the image of the ⁇  ⁇  connecting the ancient capital of Japan in two colors is considered to be 'a ⁇  image.'
The jurisdiction ( ⁇  type): West Japan Railway Company ( ⁇  operator)
Route distance (operation kilometers): 34.7▁km
Track gauge: ⁇ ▁mm
Number of stations: 19 (including the starting and terminal stations)
 ⁇ -track section: Shinden - Uji section, JR ⁇  - Kyoto▁section
 ⁇ ed section: entire line (DC 1500V)
 ⁇  ( ⁇ ) system: automatic block system ( ⁇ -track section) and single-track automatic block system (track section)
 ⁇  device: A ⁇  Train Stop▁system
Operation center: Shin-Osaka General Operation▁Center
M ⁇  speed: ⁇  km/h ( ⁇  speed) and ⁇  km/h ( ⁇  track section)
Except for Kizu Station, the Kyoto Branch Office of West Japan Railway Company (Kizu Station is managed by the Osaka Branch Office of West Japan Railway Company).
The name of the line is given to the Nara Line between Kyoto and Kizu, but all sections are located in Kyoto Prefecture and Nara Prefecture, and there is no bus route in Nara Prefecture.
This was because the line was separated from Kizu Station to the south of Kizu Station as part of the Osaka - Nagoya route after the Kansai Railway was merged into Kansai Railway Company, but it was partly separated from Kyoto and Osaka Railway.
However, trains are operated from Kizu Station to Nara Station (Yamatoji Line) via the Kansai Main Line.
JR West established the nickname of the line (JR Kyoto Line and JR Kobe Line) on the ⁇  of the Urban Network on March 13, 1988, but the Nara Line was sent to see the nickname.
Since Kintetsu Nara Line is also operated by Kintetsu Railway, it is sometimes called 'JR Nara Line.'
During the era of Japan National Railways, the station was called ' ⁇  Nara Line of Japan National Railways' and the English letter 'JNR' was also added to the station.
Kintetsu Nara Line is in rivalry with the Yamatoji Line between Nanba and Nara, and the Kintetsu Nara Line is in the Kintetsu Kyoto Line, which is in rivalry with the Nara Line.
While many trains running parallel to the Osaka Municipal Subway and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line had been operated before the Nara Line, the Nara Line was not electrified until 1984, and even after the electrification of the JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series ⁇ , two cars of JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series ⁇  were used for a small local train.
However, after JR West was established, the operation of the trains was accelerated, and the number of trains increased rapidly, such as the four-car trains (some of them were six-car trains) in the Urban Network System, the double-track section became a double-track section, and the section became a double-track section became a double-track section, and the section became a double-track section became a double-track section, and the section became a double-track section of rapid train, such as the ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' ( ⁇ ji Rapid Service) and the rapid train service.
Today, the characteristics of commuters and ⁇ s from the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, such as tourist attractions in Uji City, and sightseeing spots in Uji City, and the ⁇  and ⁇  lines, which are located along the line, are strongly associated with the characteristics of commuters and ⁇ s.
However, the route is largely divided into the east side of the Momoyama period and the south of Joyo City, which runs parallel to the central part of the town, is the route of the Kintetsu Kyoto Line, which runs parallel to the urban area of Joyo City, and the section between ⁇  and local transportation is still in use.
The cars used for the Nara Train Depot, a branch of the Osaka Branch, are operated by the Kyoto Branch, except for Kizu Station, are managed by the Kyoto Branch Office.
J- ⁇  cards, Suica of East Japan Railway Company (JR East), ⁇  of Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central), TOICIA of Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) can be used at all stations.
However, the ticket gates are simplified in the south of Joyo Station, because the ticket gates are also provided.
Since the 'Kuroshio' train service, which ran through the Nara Line, Sakurai Line and Wakayama Line, was discontinued in 1984, local trains were operated only (for a certain time, local trains were temporarily operated temporarily), but currently four types of rapid trains, rapid trains, local trains and local trains, local trains, local trains, and local trains were operated.
It is the highest-class train in the Nara Line, and it is operated mainly in the daytime.
Basically, local trains and local trains are operated with 30 minutes on the basis of the local trains.
The nickname ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' was chosen by the general public before the timetable was revised.
Many tourists use this train connecting Kyoto and Nara as a sightseeing destination, and many passengers use it not only for Japanese but also by foreigners.
The rolling stock used is JR (West) ⁇  Train Series 221, and is operated by four-car trains or six-car trains.
The maximum speed of the trains on the Sanyo Shinkansen line is ⁇  km/h at ⁇  km/h in the daytime.
The standard time of the bus service is approximately 44 minutes from Kyoto Station, and approximately 47 minutes from Nara Station to Kyoto Station.
The trains bound for Kyoto are operated twice a day at Kamikoma Station or Tanakura Station, and they are slightly different from Miyakoji Rapid Service trains bound for Nara, so they are slightly different from those of the outbound trains in the morning and evening.
During the New Year's holidays, the train stopped at Inari Station for visitors to the shrine during the New Year's holidays.
▁History
March 3, 2001: The station was upgraded to a station of Nara Electric Railway.
March 15, 2003: The timetable was revised, and trains began to stop at Tofuku-ji Station and ⁇  Station.
It is operated during the rush hour during the rush hour.
This stop also stops at JR Ogura Station and Shinden Station (Kyoto Prefecture) that pass through ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' ( ⁇ ji Rapid Service).
The rolling stock used for the trains are operated with the ⁇  series, and they are operated with four-car trains or six-car trains.
Basically, local trains and local trains are operated with 30 minutes on the basis of the local trains.
Like the Miyakoji Rapid Service mentioned above, the Yamatoji Line stopped at Narayama Station, which stopped at the station.
Until March 2001, the ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' started, and JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series ⁇  was used for the Kyoto, Uji, Joyo ( ⁇  the operation was initially operated) and Nara, and JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series 113 was used for the operation of the ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' train, but since then, the train wasn't used in the Nara Line.
As for the operation of the trains, trains that run directly to the Yamatoji Line are operated directly.
It runs mainly in the morning and at night.
Although this was initially operated only on weekdays, it was also operated on ⁇  and holidays from March 18, 2006 to March 18,▁2006.
Although the trains between Uji and Uji Station used to run on the Uji Line, the trains for Kizu Station once stopped at night in the past due to the difference in the difference in the way to connect to the local trains, but currently the local trains running on the Uji Line are now changed to the terminal station.
All trains use JNR 103 series cars for the JR (West) ⁇  Train Series ⁇  at ⁇  and holidays, and all of them are operated on the ⁇  Line.
There is a direct train from the Yamatoji Line to the Yamatoji Line in order to operate trains on the Osaka Loop Line.
The timetable of the Nara Line was used as a seasonal express train to prevent the ⁇  of the Yamatoji Line, and the color of the color of the color of the same color as ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' or ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' was used, but the type of train-car trains on the Nara Line ceased to be used with green letters due to the timetable revision of March▁2008.
The letter indicating the station's destination display at the stations north of Kamikoma Station is written in purple letters.
It runs between Kyoto Station, Uji Station, Joyo Station and Kameoka Station.
During the daytime, the operation between Kyoto Station and Joyo Station was operated every 15 minutes, but the section between Joyo Station and Kizu Station became 30 minutes.
Basically, the train is operated with the 103 series, but some of the trains are operated with the ⁇  series.
In the early morning and late night, direct trains run directly to the Yamatoji Line in the morning and late night.
In the past, there were some routes that were operated between Sakurai and Sakurai, but in September 1994, the Nara Line and Sakurai Line were divided into two lines.
Although it is a terminal station, trains that run on the Nara Line sometimes run on the Nara Line.
From 1987 to 1988, the nickname 'Kuroshio' (train) and 'Kuroshio (train)' (train) were used for the trains of JNR, and from 1988 to 1989, the train was operated between Kyoto Station and Shirahama Station on the Kansai Main Line, the Hanwa Line, the Hanwa Line and the Hanwa Line of the Kansai Main Line.
The Kinki edition of the first edition of the timetable on January 6, 1998 announced that the timetable was made on the Nara Line ( ⁇  81 cars were operated as regular trains), but the plan was later cancelled.
Although there were some time when the operation between Kyoto Station and Sakurai Station (between Kyoto and Nara was a special rapid train), no special rapid trains to the Sakurai Line, including the special rapid trains, were operated.
In mid-August, the Uji-gawa River ⁇  ⁇  Festival, which is the nearest bus service to the Uji-gawa River, is operated every special schedule until the last time of 16 a year, because the transportation capacity cannot be secured, all of the local trains are operated only at the time of 16 a year, and after 16 a.m., the trains are operated with a length of about 10 minutes.
Some local trains arrive at and depart from Kizu Station.
The timetable of March 3 at that time was a special schedule for the first time, and Rapid trains were operated between Kyoto Station and Uji Station, while the number of trains was increased to three.
Some trains were introduced to the Momoyama Station.
Around 1992, a train to Sakurai Line was operated once a day to reach Tenri Station by extending the regular Rapid Service to Sakurai Line, mainly on ⁇  and holidays.
In addition, trains that are exclusively operated exclusively for groups of organizations are sometimes operated from all over Japan.
Especially, when the Tenrikyo ⁇ tai (Tenri Tenrikyo ⁇ ) is held on October 26, trains called 'group train service for the Tenrikyo ⁇ ' ( ⁇  Train Service) are directly connected to the Tenri Station - Kizu Station - Kizu Station - Nara Station - Nara Station - Sakurai Line.
All of them belong to Nara Train Depot.
JR (West) ⁇  Train Series<unk>
The trains used in common with Yamatoji Line and Osaka Loop Line, and there are two cars, four cars and six cars.
Although the operation of the four-car trains is mainly done in the ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' and ' ⁇  Rapid Service' and the six-car trains, the four-car trains are mainly used on the Nara Line.
Two-car trains are seen on holidays.
JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series▁103
Rapid trains of the Nara Line, which are used for local trains on the Nara Line, are operated not only on the Nara Line but also on the Nara Line, but on the other hand, eight-car trains, which are operated with eight-car trains, and on the Yamatoji Line during rush hour, they are also operated on the Yamatoji Line and the Yamatoji Line.
Some of the cars are replaced with the cars transferred from the Morinomiya Train Depot to the Tenkyu Train Depot.
The Nara Railway opened the section between Kyoto and Kizu, but the section between Kyoto and Momoyama was initially connected to the current route of the current Kintetsu Kyoto Line.

The distance from the Setahigashi Interchange to the Oyamazaki Interchange is shorter than that of Meishin Expressway, and if Keiji Bypass is a ⁇  of the Keiji Bypass, the route is shorter than that of Meishin Expressway, the route is easier to go through the Keiji Bypass.
Because there are no facilities for passengers such as service areas, the Meishin Expressway is often more convenient (the facilities for passengers going to the east of Seta Station of Meishin Expressway are two stations on the Otsu Service Area and the Katsuragawa ⁇  Area).
However, because the structure of the two bridges of Seta Higashi and Oyamazaki stations was created after the god's name (especially the structure of the Oyamazaki- ⁇  Station) was ⁇ , the operation of the trains was reduced by the LD system ( ⁇  Expressway).
There is a ⁇  that when you go from Oyamazaki Station to ⁇  Station or arrive at the left side of Meishin Expressway, you may sometimes be allowed to join the Meishin Expressway.
Also, because there are many ⁇ s and slopes on the way, the traffic jams are far from the mountain, it's not fully equipped with the Meishin Expressway.

Higashi Hongan-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) located in Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.
It is the head temple of the Shinshu sect, one of the Shinshu sect's ⁇  ( ⁇ -ji Temple's ten major temples) and is the head temple of the Jodo Shinshu sect, along with Nishi Hongan-ji Temple (the formal name of the head temple of the Hongan-ji Temple).
The formal name of the temple was 'Hongan-ji Temple' until 1987, and the same year it was 'Shin Shinshu Honbyo' (the original name of the sect's sect) and thereafter.

Located in the present Karasuma Shichijo, Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City, it came to be called Higashi Hongan-ji Temple because it is located in the east of Nishi Hongan-ji Temple located at Horikawa Shichijo, Horikawa-shichijo.
In 1987, Hongan-ji Temple as a religious corporation with Otani school and ⁇  was dissolved into a religious sect and was integrated into a sect.

Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is a god (god) appearing in Japanese Mythology.
In "Engishiki" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), 'Amateru' is referred to as 'Amateru' in case of ⁇ -jinja Shrine as a natural god.
It is a godification of the sun and is considered one of the gods ( ⁇ soshin) of the Imperial Family.
In "Kojiki," it is written as Amatsu ⁇  no kami (天津天御 ⁇ 神) in "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters) and in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), it is written as Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
It is also known as Ohirume no michi no kami.
While in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), there are several gods in the names of the gods, in the "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), it is described as 'Tenshodai okami' (the god of heaven and earth).
Although she is a goddess, there is a different theory that she was actually a male god.
As the name Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is used in political parts such as "Kotai Jingu ⁇  ⁇  Cho" (the list of the ceremonies of Kotai Jingu Shrine), there is a theory that ⁇  and Nishi ⁇  were originally the ancestor gods of the Imperial Family, and therefore, some say that ⁇  was the ancestor of the Imperial Family and became Amaterasu Omikami.
In Ise-jingu Shrine, it is usually called Amatsumara okami or Sume oomikami, and when chanting a name before a Shinto ritual, it is also called Amatsu kami okami.
Today, in academic documents, the ⁇  of the ⁇  and Katakana are considered to be the same as the ones written in hiragana (Japanese syllabary characters).
There is also a theory that it was written as 天 ⁇ 神 in ancient times.
Description in▁mythology
According to "Kojiki," when Izanagi returned from the ⁇  of Izanami and washed ⁇ , he was born when he washed ⁇  on his left eye.
At this time, she was called ⁇  no Mikoto (the third-highest-ranked deity of the Imperial Court), along with her nose, and Susanoo.
At this time, Izanagi ordered Amaterasu Omikami to ⁇  Takamanohara.
Susanoo, who was entrusted with the sea, was exiled by Izanagi because he was ⁇  to the ⁇  of Izanagi who had been hiding in the land of Izanami.
Susanoo met his older sister Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) before ⁇ , but Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) thought that his younger brother, Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) would come to Takamanohara (plain of high heaven), and he was given an armed ⁇ .
Susanoo made ⁇  no kami (the god of the sea) to ⁇  her ⁇ , and five gods from the real world of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) were born from the real world, and Susano won the victory.
Amaterasu Omikami was born from the realities of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and Amaterasu Omikami was the child of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess), the following five gods.
Amenooshihomimimimimimimi
Amenohohi
Amatsuhikone
Irihikone
Kumanokusubi
Susanoo, who was ⁇  by this, worked for Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains) in Takamanohara (plain of high heaven), and as a result, Amaterasu Omikami hid herself in the cave.
The ⁇  became apparent, and various misfortunes occurred.
(Yaomata no Mikoto, the god of Chichibu, and Ame no ⁇  no Mikoto, the god of Ashihara no ⁇ , succeeded to ⁇  from heaven and earth by Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) by ⁇ ing Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) from the rock cave, and Susanoo was exiled from Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).
 ⁇  no kami sent his son, Amenooshihomimi to ⁇  Ashihara no ⁇ .
Ninigi was subdued and ⁇  no ⁇  was determined to ⁇  Ashihara no ⁇ , but Ninigi, who was born during the time of Ninigi, gave him Ninigi's grandson Ninigi.
<unk>
In mythology, there is a view that Amaterasu Omikami was a ⁇  of the emperor by performing religious services in the gods because he was ⁇  in the ⁇  of Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains) (the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess) who was born earlier than him, or in the scene of the scene in which he acted in accordance with the instructions of the Emperor, and that Amaterasu Omikami was enshrined in the Shinto religion.
Some people consider that it is a ⁇  of ancient miko.
Another name 'Hirume' is 'Hime no Onna' (Himerume of the sun) and it is a shrine maiden who served the sun god.
Although the sun god is originally male god, there is a theory that miko who served it is considered to be the sun god, and became a goddess.
There is also a theory that the goddess was the empress, who was born around the time of Empress Jito, and that today, Himiko was a model for Amaterasu Omikami.
According to "Reiho Gofu" (the ⁇  of the Five ⁇  of the ⁇ ) ( ⁇  the ⁇  of the ⁇  Dharma) ( ⁇  the early seventh century) of the sutras and sutras of the sun of Tsukuyomi and Tsukuyomi no mikoto, the birth of Tsukuyomi is pointed out in "Meezing the moon and the moon" ( ⁇  the moon before the sixth century), and in "Horiho ⁇ kyo" ( ⁇  of the ⁇  of the ⁇  of the ⁇  Dharma) ( ⁇  of the ⁇  of the ⁇ ) ( ⁇  of the ⁇  of the ⁇ ) ( ⁇  of the Five Classics) ( ⁇  of the ⁇ ) ( ⁇  of the ⁇ ) ( ⁇  of the Age of ⁇ ) ( ⁇  of the Gods) and the Moon ( ⁇ ) of Tsukuyomi ( ⁇ ) of Tsukuyomi no kami ( ⁇ ) and Tsukuyomi no kami (god of the sun goddess of the sun goddess of the sun goddess) (god of heaven) in the sun goddess of the▁sun
Also, the concept of the shrines and the shrines of Ise Jingu Shrine, such as Ise-jingu Shrine, Ise-jingu Shrine, Saigu-no-miya Shrine, ⁇ -no-Miya, ⁇ -no- ⁇ , ⁇ -no- ⁇ , ⁇ - ⁇ , ⁇ -no- ⁇ , ⁇ -no- ⁇ , and ⁇ - ⁇  are also associated with the concept of Kotai-jingu Shrine.
Based on the comparison, there is a view that the myth of birth of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and others in the mythological age (the third to fourth century) correspond to the Banko myth.
There is also a theory that the myth of Tsukuyomi, which is the moon, spread throughout Asia, was a myth that it was introduced to Japan along with the ethnic groups of the preceding periods.
According to one theory, in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), ⁇  transformed into the third stage.
The following is a summary of the events and contents.
 ⁇ : The Taika Reforms were revised.
Before this, the Imperial Family had no choice but to enshrine Amaterasu Omikami.
Hinokami' (the sun god) is called 'Hinokami' (the sun god).
A male god who was called 'Ateruteru' is widely known.
In "Engishiki" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), there are shrines with the pronunciation of 'Amateru-jinja Shrine' in Tsushima and 'Amateruteruteru-jinja Shrine' in Harima, 'Amateru-jinja Shrine' in Tanba.
Incidentally, Amenomateru is another name for Amenohoakari, a grandson of Amaterasu, and Amenohoakari is the founder of the Owari clan, Tsumori clan and Kaibe clan.
Also, this ⁇  was Ninigi's younger brother, who was the grandson of ⁇ , and was the grandson of Emperor Jinmu.
672: Jinshin▁War
The word 'Ohirume no michi' (literally, ' ⁇  sun god') is also used for ' ⁇  no hiru' (literally, 'sun god') and ' ⁇ natsumetsu' (literally, 'a woman who worships the sun god').
In this case, the deity is interpreted as a female deity, and the deity is interpreted as a male god, 'Ateru' of the snake.
 ⁇ : The shrine was built at Kotai-jingu Shrine.
She is the ' ⁇  of Amaterasu' (the Sun Goddess) and 'the ancestor of the Imperial Family.'
She is a goddess.
It was created from the nature god to the humanized god as a model for Empress Jito.
After that, 'Tenteru' other than Kososhin were called 'Amateru.'
For example, in " ⁇  ⁇ " ( ⁇  of the Past) (around 1060), the part of 'Amateru' is read as 'Amateru' and the part of 'Amateruhiko' is also read as 'Amateru no Kami' and it is also written as 'Ameteruhiko no Kami.'
1880-1881: A fierce controversy arose in Shinto circles over the enshrined deity of the Shinto ⁇  Shrine, which was established in Tokyo.
Shinto ⁇  ( ⁇  of Shinto) insisted that the four deities enshrined in the shrine of the ⁇  ( ⁇  of Shinto), ⁇  no kami (the god of heaven), ⁇  no kami (the god of high heaven), and Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) should be enshrined, but 'Izumo school' should be considered as 'Yugen ichinyo' ( ⁇  of the world) and ' ⁇ ' ( ⁇  of the world) and ' ⁇ ' ( ⁇  of the world) should be united to govern the world).
However, 'Ise school', the central organization of Shinto ⁇ , was 'Tenchi Dai- ⁇ ' (Great ⁇  of Heaven and Earth) which ruled the ⁇  world, and other gods opposed the idea of ⁇ ing the retainers.
Various theories were finally formed, including ' ⁇ -ha group ⁇  the ⁇  of the ⁇  years from the age of the gods,' ' ⁇ ing the ⁇  of Senke, who had been ⁇  in the Imperial Family, to kill ⁇ , who had been ⁇  in the Imperial Family.'
Before long, this dispute was settled by the Emperor Meiji's decision (the Izumo faction was defeated) and Amaterasu Omikami's deification was finally realized.
It is said that the government recognized the possibility of the creation of the creed system common in Shinto and that it was impossible to control the people directly by the Fukko-setsu (the theory of restoration) based on the Fukko-setsu (the theory of Fukko- ⁇ ing the ancient Shinto) theory.
See the dispute on the enshrined deity of the Shinto ⁇  (Shinto ⁇ ) ⁇  (Shinto ⁇ ) in Atsuta-jingu Shrine.
 ⁇  ⁇  used another name, 'Ohiruchimuchi' when he appeared in his novel.
This is because the term ' ⁇  Omikami' comes from the fact that the ancestor gods appear in the text, and the sun god and the god are also called 'Taihi no kami' because they are based on nature gods.
In fact, there is a description in the novel by ⁇  that he was ⁇  to kill the enemy by the ⁇ , the ⁇ , and the ⁇ , and that he could not understand the story.
Masanori AIOKA (1898 - 1983) who established Konkei Gakuin Gakko ( ⁇  Institute) established 'There is a belief in Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) in Japan.
Amaterasu Omikami is the ideal of the world to ⁇  the world by the Japanese spirit.
In the 'Iza' of Izanami and Izanagi, the ideal of 'Iza' is that if you say, you should be a ⁇  of the world, and that is, the pioneers of the world, and the pioneers of the world, and the ⁇ s of the ⁇ s.'
Shrines that enshrine Amaterasu▁Omikami
The shrines that enshrine Amaterasu Omikami are called ⁇ -jinja Shrines throughout Japan, and the head shrine is located in the precincts of Ise-jingu Shrine ( ⁇ -jingu Shrine).
Kotai-jingu Shrine is one of the Three Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family, and it is a shrine that enshrines Yata no Kagami (the eight-span mirror) as a branch shrine.
Most of the shrines throughout Japan enshrine the sacred sword (Daijingu Daima) of Kotai-jingu Shrine (Amateru-jingu Shrine).
Daimyo is a term that refers to the lord of a daimyo (Japanese feudal lord).
It refers to a person who has a great reputation as a ⁇ .
The name "tsuitoshi" is a small name.
The word "people who were originally ⁇  in the provinces" was originally referred to as "people who had power in the provinces."
Among them, in the samurai society, it became a word that meant many samurai owned their territories and their subordinates.
In the Muromachi period, shugo (provincial constables) strengthened their control over their own territory, and became shugo daimyo (shugo, which were Japanese provincial military governors, that became daimyo, which were Japanese feudal lords).
During the Sengoku period (period of warring states), a large feudal lord who established the ⁇  of the ⁇ - ⁇  territory appeared, and it was called Kokujin (local samurai) or daimyo (Japanese territorial lord) in the Sengoku period.
During the Edo period, the family became buke ⁇  (samurai family) given by the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) with a fief of more than 10,000 koku (approximately 1.8 million liters of crop yield) in the Edo period.
Among samurai with a stipend of less than 10,000 koku, samurai under the direct control of the bakufu were called jikisan.
In addition, daimyo shared the character of feudal lords and their character in the feudal lords' nature, and were treated as daimyo by ⁇ ing them to lords.
In this section, the details of the early-modern daimyo in the Edo period are described below.
For the shugo daimyo (shugo, which were Japanese provincial military governors, that became daimyo, which were Japanese feudal lords) and Sengoku daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period), refer to the article on this article.
 ⁇ -do▁Hall
The social standing of the family was determined by the social status, official rank, the stipend, the post of the ⁇ , and the ⁇ seki ( ⁇  rank next to the three Empresses: Great Empress Dowager, Empress Dowager, Empress Dowager, and Empress).
Firstly, due to the relationship with the Tokugawa Shogun family, it was classified into the Miie family (Shinpan, Shinpan daimyo), Fudai daimyo (hereditary vassals of the Tokugawa family) who were vassals of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara, Fudai daimyo (hereditary vassals of the Tokugawa family) and Fudai daimyo (hereditary daimyo) who were mainly vassals of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara, and from around the Battle of Sekigahara onwards onwards, they were classified as tozama daimyo (nonhereditary feudal lord).
The first shogun, Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, in order to maintain the ⁇ -ke lineage, and ⁇ ing the control of daimyo throughout the country, established a system to ⁇  the Tokugawa family, and to assist the Shogun family, and established the Owari Tokugawa family, which allowed the ninth son Yoshinao TOKUGAWA to be allowed to be the Tokugawa family, and the Kishu Domain, and Yorifusa TOKUGAWA, the eleventh son, to the Mito Domain, to ⁇  Yorifusa TOKUGAWA, the eleventh son of the shogun.
Furthermore, he appointed Ieyasu's second son, Hideyasu YUKI, to Echizen Domain, and also established the Tokugawa clan's own daimyo throughout the country.
Furthermore, he was entrusted to the important posts mainly for the Tairo (chief minister) of the bakufu, such as Tairo (chief minister) of the bakufu, in keeping the Fudai daimyo (hereditary vassals) who had established the Tokugawa Shogun family's ⁇  (a group of hereditary vassals) for successive generations, and to secure military power in the bakufu, and to take the post of Tairo (chief minister) in charge of the shogunate government.
Fudai daimyo (hereditary vassals of the Tokugawa family) were relatively low, and the fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) with a stipend of 350,000 koku (approximately 1.8 million liters of crop yield) of rice crop yield, which was the head of the Ii clan, was relatively large, but in the Edo period, fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) with more than 100,000 koku (approximately 1.8 million liters of crop yield) were given additional properties, including the Torii clan, ⁇ bara clan, the Honda clan, Ogasawara clan, Ogasawara clan, and Ogasawara clan, and the ⁇  clan.
This became the reason for separation of power and military power.
 ⁇  daimyo (nonhereditary feudal lord) after the Battle of Sekigahara were subordinate daimyos, and many of them were opposed to the Tokugawa family in the Battle of Sekigahara.
For this reason, the bakufu's ⁇  was strongly ⁇ ed by the ⁇  and ⁇  activities by secret agents, and if there were fears of ⁇  or rebellions, it was strictly prohibited to ⁇  punishment.
The most prominent tozama daimyo were Kaga Domain, Kaga Domain, Satsuma Domain, Sendai Domain, Sendai Domain, Sendai Domain, Shonai Domain, Yonezawa Domain, Uesugi clan, Uesugi clan, Uesugi clan, Uesugi clan, Hiroshima Domain, Hiroshima Domain, Fukuoka Domain, Hiroshima Domain, Hiroshima Domain, Hiroshima Domain, Hiroshima Domain, Hiroshima Domain, Tosa Domain, Tosa Domain, Tosa Domain, Tosa Domain, Tosa Domain, Tosa Domain, Tosa Domain, and Akita Domain, which were famous as Kaga Hyakugoku ⁇  (One Hundred ⁇  of Kaga Province), and the famous ⁇  daimyo (nonhereditary feudal lord).
In addition, the status of daimyo was divided according to the status of daimyo, whether the daimyo's territory was one or more, or the ⁇  daimyo who had a castle, or the castle was called joshu daimyo (daimyo without a castle) or ⁇ , and the status of the daimyo who had a castle was given to the Edo-jo Castle was also different from that of the daimyo.
For details, refer to the section on " ⁇ -seki" (literally, " ⁇  seats").
Daimyo (feudal lords) had the level of daimyo who had the level of the daimyo, and most daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) in the ten thousand koku (crop yields) possessed the entire land of ⁇ , and their territories were still in the vicinity of the castle town.
In the case of the ⁇ , one village was divided into other feudal lords and ruled ( ⁇  kyu).
Daimyo (feudal lord) with a fief of more than 10,000 koku, but the Kitsura Domain of the ⁇  clan was 5,000 koku.
This is because the ⁇  clan was descended from the Ashikaga clan.
Daimyo were controlled by the bakufu by the system of ⁇  (three privileged branches of Tokugawa family) and ⁇  (daimyo's alternate-year residence in Edo) under the control of Buke ⁇  ( ⁇ s of the Military Houses).
In addition, the role of yakuden ( ⁇  service) called ote-den ( ⁇  service) or in the end of Edo period, the daimyo were always in financial difficulties because they were ordered to defend coastal areas.
 ⁇ s of▁Daimyo
Kazoku kazoku were those who were from daimyo (Japanese feudal lords) and feudal lords.
Daimyo-yashiki residences (daimyo's residence)
There were several places in Edo, and the main residence was called Kamiyashiki (literally, upper residence) or other residences.
Daimyo-nen no sama (daimyo's ⁇ ) was a ⁇ -sama (a person who has yet to come to a high rank) like daimyo (Japanese feudal lord).
Daimyo-gyoretsu (daimyo's procession of feudal lords) was a procession of feudal lords to move to the front during the ⁇  (a system under which feudal lords were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo) during the Edo period.
In some cases, a group of people surrounded by a key person is sometimes used to ⁇ e the ⁇ .
Daimyo hike hike (firearms of daimyo) was a troop of the ⁇  ( ⁇ s of the Edo bakufu) in Edo that ordered daimyo to make them.
It consisted of feudal retainers of domains.
The daimyogashiya lending the loan to daimyo to their kurabugyo ( ⁇ s who were allowed to live in Edo).
Daimyo entrusted to the daimyo (feudal lord) and entrusted the management of criminals to the daimyo.
Daimyo fushin: A simple fushin.
