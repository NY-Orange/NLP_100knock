Umekoji Steam ⁇  Museum is an exhibition facility for steam locomotives managed by West Japan Railway Company (JR West) in Kankiji-cho, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.
On October 10, 1972, it was opened to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Japan's opening of Japan National Railways ( ⁇ ) to commemorate the opening of Japan National Railways, and it was the first facility to preserve steam locomotives as precious cultural properties and preserve them.
JR West succeeded to JR West due to the division and privatization of JNR in 1987.
This facility itself is an active car base (Umekoji ⁇  Operation Center) and has been ⁇ ed and tested by JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series ⁇  and diesel locomotives owned by the Sagano Scenic Railway.
In the first place, the development of steam locomotives rapidly disappeared from the latter half of the 1960s.
At first, because it was close to Kashihara City, Tochigi Prefecture, it was the most likely candidate for the ⁇ -ku Ward, which was located in Oyama Station, Tochigi Prefecture, but when it was located in 'the central part of Japan', it was decided that Umekoji-ku Ward (the present-day Umekoji-ku Ward) was located in 'the central area of Japan,' and it was officially selected as a preservation district for the preservation district.
In principle, it was decided that the existing cars should select the latest cars (one- ⁇  machine), but there were some cars that were not expected to be preserved at first, such as C6262 model No.2.
The facility consists of the "Rose exhibition hall," which uses a fantasy for the old Umekoji-ku Ward, and the "Rose exhibition hall," which has been reconstructed and restored by the former Nijo Station house.
A Sensu-type ⁇  was made of reinforced concrete built in 1914, and it was designated as a national important cultural property along with a five-treduction fluctune ceiling (completed in 1915).
In 2004, it was selected as a civil engineering worker for civil engineering selection of civil engineering.
In 2006, the old Nijo Station ( ⁇  Exhibition Hall), the Ogi-type train-car train-car train-car train, the one-car train-car train-cars, the one-car train-car train-cars, and the repairs were designated as the semi- ⁇  railway- ⁇  railway.
The former Nijo station building was built in 1904 by the oldest two-storey Japanese-style Japanese-style house, which was built by Kyoto Electric Railway as the head office building, and was built in front of Heian-jingu Shrine in consideration of the landscape.
Kyoto Electric Railway was ⁇  in 1907, and subsequently used as a station for the JR ⁇  Station and then JR ⁇  Station; however, in 1996 it was completed as a station house for the ⁇  of the Sanin Main Line ( ⁇  Line) - Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture), and in 1997 it was relocated and reconstructed on the premises of the main building of the main building, and in 1997, the interior was moved and reconstructed as a facility for the purpose of re ⁇ ing old buildings.
It was designated as a cultural property by Kyoto City in April 1996.
18 types of steam locomotives manufactured from the Taisho period to the Showa period (at the beginning of the opening of the station) were housed and exhibited in the Ogigata ⁇ .
In the early days of the opening of the station, there was a ⁇  of C53535 steam locomotives and a C51-type C23 steam locomotives, but after that, seven-car trains, which have been stored for the maintenance of storage, were conducted several times, and seven-car trains, seven-car trains, as of▁2006.
Out of these five cars, two types of cars (C57 ⁇ , C56 ⁇  ⁇ ) are still used for trains on the main line, including the Yamaguchi Line ' ⁇  (train)' and the Hokuriku Main Line ' ⁇  (train)' on the Hokuriku Main Line and the Hokuriku Main Line.
It is impossible to run on the main line because of the lack of inspections in the general inspections of cars other than these two cars.
Also, the 'SL team' train-cars, which are stored in the museum, are operated by the rails in the museum.
This display route used to be connected to the northern end of the premises of large-size parking lot (which once had a large-size parking lot in the premises of the station), but it was changed to the current Umekoji-koen Park to connect the Sagano Line with the Sagano- ⁇  Line.
Even today, it has a function as an institution, and is connected with a commercial line.
Furthermore, after the Takatori factory of West Japan Railway Company was closed, steam locomotives were also improved.
Japanese▁plum
It originates from 'Ume' which means Umekoji.
All trains except C62 Type 62, which had been designated in 1976, have been designated as a special railway operator since 2006, and it has been designated as a special railway operator along with maintenance equipment.
The procedures in which no special mention is made are made in 1972 from the previous organization of the organization.
Umekoji Station has no registered address since the preservation of Umekoji Station.

Shomyo is one of Japanese traditional music.
It is a religious music that is used for rites and festivals.
It is also called Bonbai or Bonnoku in Japan.
In the old ⁇ , it is written as  ⁇  in hiragana (Japanese syllabary characters).
It is one of the academic fields (gomyo or gomyo).
Gomyo refers to the five subjects of Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s), Sakumei ( ⁇ s of Philosophy, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology), Ippo ( ⁇ s of medicine), Inmyo ( ⁇ s of medicine), Naimyo ( ⁇ s of ethics), and Naimyogaku ( ⁇ s of Buddhism).
It was introduced into Japan along with Buddhism.
There is a record that a Buddhist memorial service was held in ⁇  when the Great Buddha of Todai-ji Temple was held, and it is thought that Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) was actively performed in the Nara period.
In the early Heian period, Saicho and Kukai transmitted Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) to become the basis of Tendai Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) and Shingon Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant).
Even in Buddhist sects other than the Tendai sect and Shingon sect, each sect has their own Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) and has been handed down to the present day.
Since Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) passed down in oral teachings, there was no evidence to prove it.
Therefore, ⁇  was extremely difficult.
Later, hakase (master of astronomy) was invented by ⁇ , the equivalent of tenmon hakase (master of astronomy).
Also, depending on each school, the term " ⁇ " is used for specialized terms such as hakase.
However, hakase is a reference for chanting Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) and in order to learn Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s), it is necessary to acquire and inherit the teachings from master to disciple, and it is impossible to maintain and inherit the teachings of Buddha from master to disciple.
Therefore, the development of leaders and successors was required.
As a result of various conditions, many schools disappeared.
Tendai Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) was introduced by Saicho, and developed independently.
After Saicho, Ennin and Annen flourished.
 ⁇ , the founder of ⁇ -ji Temple, is known as the Chuko no So (father of restoration).
In ⁇ , ⁇  built ⁇ -in Temple ( ⁇  Ward, Kyoto City) in Ohara, Kyoto.
The sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Gyozan of ⁇ -in Temple in Ohara, and is modeled after Mt. Gyozan in China.
Later, ⁇ -in Temple and Shoko-in Temple became known as the training hall for Shomyo Nenbutsu (Buddhist liturgical chant) of Ohara-ryu School.
Later, Jakugen formed a group, and in Ohara there was a statement of Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) of the two schools.
Later, ⁇  revived Ohara Shomyo (chanting of Ohara).
Tanchi developed the trend based on the new music theory.
Since then, it has been handed down as the center of Tendai Shomyo (chanting of Tendai Shomyo).
The Shomyo Nenbutsu sect, Jodo sect, Jodo Shinshu sect (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) and Jodo Shinshu sect (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) are the lineages of Tendai Shomyo.
Shingon Shomyo (chanting of Shingon Buddhism) was based on Kukai's ⁇ , and it is known that it was founded by Kukai.
It was after the mid-Edo period that Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ ) was ⁇ .
Kancho can be said to have been the ⁇  of the restoration.
He strived to compose and improve Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ ).
There were many schools until the Kamakura period, but four schools were established by Cloistered Imperial Prince Kakusho (Honsoin school, Shinsoin school, Daigo school, Daigo school, and Oishin school).
The Shomyo of the Kogi Shingon sect declined and disappeared during the Edo period.
Honpoin-ryu, Shinpo-in-ryu, Daigo-ryu and Daigo-ryu were abolished in the early Meiji period.
Currently, it is divided into Chizan Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant), Buzan Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant), Nara Hase-dera Temple and Nanzan Shinzan Shinryu (Mt. Koya, Mt. Koya, Koyasan Shingon Sect temple in Kyoto).
The Shomyo Nenbutsu (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) of the Shingon sect Chizan school and the Shingon sect ⁇  school of Shingon Buddhism are derived from the ⁇  school of the Nakagawa school.
Raising Yoriudo to the Daigo-ryu school.
When Negoro-ji Temple ( ⁇  Prefecture) was burned down by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI in 1583, the Negoro-ji Temple in Mt. Chisan and Mt. Toyoyama fell into a group based on the old school of Daigo.
 ⁇ istically, it is called 'rongi' or 'shomyo' in Mt. ⁇ .
The Nakagawa Oshin school of the Nanzan Shingi Shingon sect (Kogi Shingon sect Shomyo) became the original school.
Nakagawa Oshin-ryu school was founded by Daidoshi of Nakagawa-dera Temple in Nara Prefecture.
During the Teiei era (1232 - ⁇ ), Katsushin of Mt. Koya and Sanbo-in Temple moved his base to Mt. Koya.
Later, he changed his name to Mt. Koya, which was another name for Mt. Koya, to Mt. Nanshin-ryu.
He was the founder of the ⁇  school and the Noshin school.
The music of ⁇  such as Heikyoku, Yokyoku (Noh song), Joruri ( ⁇  narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment), Joruri ( ⁇  narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment), Joruri ( ⁇  narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment) and Joruri ( ⁇  narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment) can be regarded as the turning point of Shomyo.
It had a great influence on ⁇  music.

His imina (personal name) was ⁇  (or Katsuragi).
It is thought that he was called Katsuragi no Miko or Katsuragi no Miko while he was alive.
He is generally known as Naka no Oe no Oji (also known as Naka no Oe no Oji).

▁Summary

He conspired with NAKATOMI no Kamatari and plotted a coup d' ⁇ , and he was assassinated by his uncle, Emperor Kotoku, and he himself became the crown prince.
And he established the era name Taika and implemented various reforms (the Taika Reforms, the Taika Reforms).
In addition, he was sentenced to death by ⁇ ing his political power, which caused a coup d' ⁇  in later years, such as the Coup of ⁇ .
Because Baekje was destroyed by the Tang Dynasty and Silla Dynasty in 660, he sent ⁇  FUYO, a son of the King of Paekche who stayed in the Imperial Court, to revive Baekje.
He stayed in Tsukushi in order to lead Baekje, but in 661, Empress Saimei passed away.
After that, the Emperor continued to ⁇  the Imperial Throne for a long time, but in 663, he moved the capital to Otsu City and ascended the throne there.
After the Battle of Shiramura, he set up mizu-shiro (castles built on lakes or ⁇ es for defensive reasons) as a part of the national defense policy for national defense, and set fire and defenses.
Furthermore, there were reforms such as the reform of the system reform in the 19th and 16th levels of cap rank.

However, in the Jinshin War that broke out after the death of Emperor Tenchi, his younger brother, Prince Oama (Emperor Tenmu) succeeded to the throne and ascended the throne.
After that, the Emperor Tenmu of the lineage of Emperor Tenmu was enthroned as Emperor Shotoku.

Brief Personal▁History
626 - Born.
The Crown Prince was formally installed as the Crown Prince on July 12, ⁇ .
Saimei (August 24, 661) - Shosei system (a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code)
On February 20, ⁇ , Emperor Tenchi ascended the throne.
On January 7, 672, he died at the age of 46.
(" ⁇ " (The Mirror of the Present) says, 'There is a theory that the Emperor died of illness,' and there is a theory that says he was killed by the Emperor Tenmu side because he was killed in the mountains, because he was killed in the mountain where he had fallen ill.
Emperor Tenchi did not succeed to the throne for a long time, and it is one of the ⁇ s in political history of the late seventh century.
There are several views on this matter.
In consideration of the Emperor Tenmu's influence.
In other words, the theory is based on the theory that Emperor Tenmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi, and that the Emperor Tenmu was a prince born before Emperor Jomei married Emperor Jomei, and he was a different father of Emperor Tenchi.
In fact, if the year of Emperor Tenmu's death was calculated based on the age of Emperor Tenmu in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) and some history books, the year of Emperor Tenmu was the longest period.
However, there is no contradiction between the same historical materials, and there are many historical materials that describe about the age of eight to nine.
On the other hand, there is a thesis in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) that 'if my father was a younger brother of the Emperor Tenchi, I am a younger brother of the Emperor Tenchi,' but in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), the age of Emperor Tenchi, who was sixteen years older than his father, was enthroned after the enthronement of his father, Emperor Jomei, died.
Therefore, in 614, the year of birth was adopted by the Honcho koin jounroku (the Emperor's family tree, made in the Muromachi period).
A counterargument with " ⁇  in ancient times" ⁇  the Shosei system, which was not unusual in ancient times (Emperor Tenchi and Emperor Tenmu, whose reign was around the end of the reign of Emperor Tenmu), and did not ascend the throne immediately.
(In fact, there was a slight difference between them.)
Some people argue that it is impossible to deal with the same, because other history books which are said to have been compiled by "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) and other history books have been compiled in different ways.
(Refer to the section on 'Emperor Tenmu's age')
According to one theory, Prince Karu was expelled from his position because of a coup d' ⁇  by Karu no Miko (Emperor Kotoku).
Recently, it has been pointed out that the relationship between Prince Naka no Oe and Prince Yamashiro no Oe was relatively good, and that the basic policy was similar to that of Prince Naka no Oe.
In this way, Naka no Oe no Oji ⁇  Iruka's murder.
In addition, in the description in the Taika Reforms in the Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan), this theory was advocated based on the fact that the Taika Reforms were revised.
Also, this theory attracts attention because the reason why Emperor Kogyoku abdicated the throne and the Soga clan other than Iruka had not been exiled even after the coup d' ⁇ .
There is a theory that the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi was opposed to the female relationship of Emperor Tenchi.
This is based on the fact that Emperor Kotoku, who was described in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), presented poems to his wife, ⁇  no Himemiko (Princess ⁇  of Emperor Tenchi), which was described in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), ⁇  relations between her and Emperor Tenchi.
Although the love and marriage of ⁇  and his sister were allowed to marry each other, the situation at that time was due to the situation of ⁇ 's love at that time, and it was interpreted in fact in the story of Ame no M ⁇  no ⁇  (Emperor Kotoku), who was persuaded by his uncle Karu no Okimi (Emperor Kotoku) to have a relationship with him, and there was a scene in which he was furious about this relationship even after his uncle Karu was assassinated.
After the death of Empress Saimei, there was a theory that ⁇  no Himemiko succeeded to the Imperial Throne as the consort of the previous emperor, but some of them were ⁇  due to some reasons.
In "Manyoshu" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves), there is a theory that the character 'Naka no Mikoto' came from the theory that 'Naka no Himemiko' was a princess, and 'Naka no Mikoto' can be interpreted as a successor to Emperor Tenchi until the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi.
If ⁇  no Himemiko was called 'Naka no Mikoto', it can be said that she was given such a special title, but there is also a theory that she was Empress Saimei, and there is no doubt that she was a princess of Emperor Saimei.
Due to the nature of political history and restrictions on historical materials, it is difficult to prove, but, as a result, research has been progressing in future development, including cooperation with the results.
▁Poems
Four of his poems were selected for "Manyoshu" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) and "Shoku Nihongi" (Chronicle of Japan Continued).
In Ogura Hyakunin Isshu (the Ogura Anthology of One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Poets), KAKI ⁇  no Hitomaro as the founder of the Heian dynasty, and the following poems are included at the beginning of the poem.

He was one of the following poems in Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).
Mt. Kaguyama is a place where the ⁇  and the ears of the ⁇  and the ⁇ s come from the ancient times.
The Saionji family was a court noble descended from the Fujiwara clan.
He was a member of the House of Fujiwara clan and his social standing was the Seiga family (one of the highest court noble families in Japan at that time).
The ⁇  family and the Imadegawa family (Kikutei family) were branch families of the Saionji family.
In addition, there was the Saionji clan in Iyo Province who used the surname Saionji as a powerful branch of the Saionji family.
His Kamon (family crest) was Sanmitsudomoe.
The Saionji family was founded by FUJIWARA no Michisue, the third son of FUJIWARA no ⁇ .
During the time of Michisue's great-grandson, he was confined in the Imperial Court as a member of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) in the Jokyu War in which MINAMOTO no Yoritomo's niece, MINAMOTO no Yoritomo, was involved in the Jokyu War, and, after the war, he gained the confidence of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), seized the real power of the Imperial Court as a meritorious retainer of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) and rose to the position of Daijo daijin (Grand minister of state).
Saionji's family name was named after ⁇ -ji Temple, which was the second residence of Kintsune SAIONJI in Kyoto (Kitasoyama, Kadono County, Yamashiro Province).
This hall was also called Kitayama-dono Palace, and the current Kinkaku-ji Temple was built by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA from the Saionji family.
Starting with the support of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) since Kintsune, he had a strong influence on the Sekke (line of regents and advisers) through the Kamakura period.
 ⁇  SAIONJI married Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama), and made his daughter marry the Cloistered Emperor Kameyama and Emperor Godaigo.
However, after the death of his son, Kinhira SAIONJI, the Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama) had distanced from the Imperial Court, the conflict between the Jimyoin-to (imperial lineage from Emperor Gofukakusa to Emperor Gokomatsu) and Jimyoin-to (imperial lineage from Emperor Gofukakusa to Emperor Gokomatsu) deepened.
Later, during the time of Kinmune SAIONJI, the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) fell and the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) played an important role in the Battle of Oshu.
Kinmune harbored ⁇  HOJO (Tokioki HOJO), the remnants of the Hojo clan, and assassinated Emperor Godaigo, who started the Kenmu Restoration, and plotted to overthrow the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) after the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun); however, Kinmune was arrested and executed due to the betrayal of his younger brother, Kinshige SAIONJI.
During the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, ⁇  SAIONJI, the son of Kinmune, served the Northern Court (Japan) and became Udaijin (Minister of the Right), and restored the family name.
During the Muromachi and Edo periods, the family specialized in biwa (Japanese lute) as their family business.
During the Muromachi period, ⁇  SAIONJI invited Tadataka HOSOKAWA, the heir of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA (later disinherited) and Kyumu ⁇ , the first daughter of Kyumu ⁇ , to the position of ⁇  (Minister of the Sovereign's Household), but ⁇  did not allow him to be promoted to Sadaijin (Minister of the Left), so he gave him 600 koku to the Saionji family and donated 600 koku.
At the end of the Edo period, Kinmochi SAIONJI became an adopted son of Kinmochi SAIONJI, who was also a member of the Rikken ⁇  (a political party organized by Hirobumi ITO) at the end of the Edo period, worked as a politician after the Meiji Restoration, and played an active role in politics as a Genro ( ⁇  statesman) in the Taisho period and Showa period.
Incidentally, Kinmochi's performance of biwa (Japanese lute) in the Saionji family's family business was bitter, but during his term of prime minister, he was said to have been ⁇  by Emperor Meiji, 'I want to listen to biwa (Japanese lute) of the Saionji family from the Saionji family,' and it is said that he suffered four hardships from the staff of gagaku (ancient Japanese court dance and music) and biwa (Japanese lute) of biwa (Japanese lute) of the Imperial Court.

It is pointed out that there are some similar differences in the "Gizan Zakki" compiled by Yi-in (Gizan) of the late Tang Dynasty in China, and it is pointed out that there are some differences between them.
According to the ⁇  written at the end of the book, when Naidaijin (Minister of the Center) FUJIWARA no Teishi/Sadako presented the manuscript to his younger sister, FUJIWARA no Teishi/Sadako, at the time of the book, Sei Shonagon asked the Emperor to write "Shiki" (history book), 'The Emperor's side had copied the "Shiki" (history book).'
It is based on the fact that he was given a paper from the Imperial Palace (according to the San- ⁇ -bon line (three-volume book, 'Makura no Soshi Makura no Soshi' (The Pillow Book)) and ' ⁇  Makura no Soshi' (The Pillow Book) by Noinbon, and ' ⁇  Makura no Soshi' (The Pillow Book) and ' ⁇  Makura no soshi Makura no Soshi' (The Pillow Book) are not included in the Sakai-bon manuscript).
It is generally accepted that the name 'Makura no Soshi' comes from this.
According to "The Study of The Pillow Book" by Kazuhiko HAYASHI, he was acquainted with scholars such as ⁇  HAYASHI, ⁇  ⁇ , Shinobu ORIGUCHI, and Soseki ⁇ .

 ⁇ -bon manuscript▁theory
There is no relationship between them.
However, there is no popular theory.
In addition, 'Makura no Soshi' (The Pillow Book) was used as a common noun in " ⁇ " (The Pillow Book) to express beautiful colors.
According to the same writing, the first draft was written around ⁇ , and MINAMOTO no Tsunefusa, the author of the manuscript, brought it down from the house of the playwright MINAMOTO no Tsunefusa to the world.
Even after that, he was never heard of, and it is thought that he wrote it around the end of the year of the Kanko era.
The text of "Makura no Soshi" (The Pillow Book), which was included in "Genji monogatari ⁇ sho" (The Tale of Genji's Commentary on the Tale of Genji), has not been extant in the text of "Makura no Soshi" (The Pillow Book), which is an old commentary on "Genji Monogatari ⁇ sho" (The Tale of Genji).
It is a big difference between densebon and ⁇ .

It goes back to the end of the Kamakura period.
It is almost an established theory that the origin of Noinbon is inferior to that of the three books of Zenbon.
It consists of 230 tales except 70 tales at the beginning.

It takes the form of ⁇ .
It is a denpon (books handed down from generation to generation) during the Muromachi period.

Only a manuscript (owned by Maeda Ikutokukai) exists in Kaga Province and Kaga Province.
According to "Sei Shonagon Makura no Soshi" (The Pillow Book), she entered a box of gold Makie (golden lacquer sprinkled with gold or silver powder), and she had a gold- ⁇  box, which was called "Sei Shonagon" (The Pillow Book).
It is designated as an Important Cultural Property.
It is considered to be the oldest among the manuscripts of "Makura no Soshi" (The Pillow Book), which were transcribed by FUJIWARA no Yukinari.
Among them, the Sakai-bon manuscript was divided into two volumes in " ⁇  ⁇ " (Collection of historical documents compiled by Hokiichi ⁇ ), and the Sakai-bon manuscript was included in "Shin ⁇  ⁇  ⁇ " (New Classified Documents).
Also, Noinbon was used as an original text for old type printing in the early Edo period, so it was used as a set of commentaries such as "Makura no Soshi ⁇ " (the Pillow Book) and "Makura no Soshi Shunsho" (the Pillow Book) (by Suemura ⁇ ).
However, in 1946, the second edition of the three-volume edition was re- ⁇  by Jutaro TANAKA (1917-1987), and after the World War II, it became a situation where the text was mainly published and used for textbooks.
On the other hand, "Makura no Soshi ⁇ " (The Pillow Book), a picture scroll depicting the late Kamakura period, which seems to have been used as a three-volume book on the Wakan Roei Shu, is thought to have been used, and "Makura no Soshi ⁇ " (picture scrolls of the Pillow Book) which was completed in the latter half of the Kamakura period still exists.
The second edition of the three-volume edition has an independent chapter of more than 300 chapters.
It consists of sections such as 'Ruiju fushodan' ( ⁇ s of the Past), 'Sumo no hana' (The Flowering Flowers), 'Suzure no hana' (The Flowering Flowers) and 'Utsukumono' (Words of the Cherry ⁇ s), and 'zuishodan' ( ⁇ s of the Past) which describes the nature of the four seasons, 'zuizuishodan' ( ⁇ sages of the Present), 'zuishodan' ( ⁇ s of the Consort's Household), ' ⁇ shodan' ( ⁇  of the Consort's Household) which was seen in the 'Ruijusansho' (Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry), ' ⁇ ' ( ⁇ s Household Ministry) and ' ⁇ ' ( ⁇ ).
However, there is a commonly accepted theory that the way of classification is not clear (for example, the first chapter of 'Haru no ⁇ ' is the first chapter of 'Haru no ⁇ ,' but the latter part is different from that of Zuisho Shodan).
It is written in a simple language style using Manyo-gana (a form of syllabary used in the Manyoshu [Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves]), and many of them are simple and ⁇ , but reflecting the ⁇  of the decline of the Nakanokanpaku family and the death of his master Teishi/Sadako, it is also exposed to the ⁇  of his wounds at that time.
The refined sensibility of the playwrights and sharp observations were integrated into the ' ⁇ ' of "The Tale of Genji," and the ' ⁇ ' of "The Tale of Genji" ⁇  the beauty of the beauty of the ' ⁇ ' world.

Because "Makura no Soshi" (The Pillow Book) was deeply loved by human beings and nature, it was created as a beauty of polysaccharide in various fields (by Sakusaku ⁇ ).
In the next chapter of each chapter, there is no distinction between ⁇ s, ⁇ s, ⁇ s, and ⁇ s, and the material is ⁇  by the expression of the weathering of the sky by the expression of ' ⁇ ' (Kogigaya).
The expression of ' ⁇  - ⁇ ' ( ⁇  in spring, etc.) ( ⁇ , etc.) in those days, followed by ' ⁇  - ⁇  - Asa' which was seen in hiragana (Japanese syllabary characters) at that time, and followed by ' ⁇  - Asa' ( ⁇ ) and '朝朝朝顔' ( ⁇ ) and '朝顔' ( ⁇ ) which was a ⁇  match for the readers who were familiar with the traditional Japanese traditional culture.
It was the ⁇  of Teishi's ⁇  to Chugu Teishi.
It was written in order to calm the soul of Teishi, who died while Michitaka's family fell into decline.
Therefore, it is a matter of course that Michitaka's family declined (same as above).
Even in the era when people who took care of chugu (the second consort of an emperor) and chugu (the second consort of an emperor) were disappointed, they insisted that they lived in the world of love and good fortune ( ⁇ ).
Evaluation of Chosen▁Tsushinshi
It is a ⁇  portraying Sei Shonagon, who was ⁇  from the class of Sei Shonagon, and tried to ⁇  him into the upper class (according to another theory, he was exiled to Mt. Akiyama).
(There is no ⁇  for those who have high social status than those of his own family.)
There is a description in ' ⁇  of the Civilization of Teishi' that does not have been written according to the qualification of ' ⁇ ' ( ⁇  by Kenji ISHIDA).
Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA was the 15th Seii Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) (his reign was from December 5, 1866 to December 9, 1867).
He was the only shogun who did not carry out his duty as Shogun in Edo-jo Castle.
He was Naidaijin (Minister of the Center) and Juichii (Junior First Rank) the First Order of Merit.
He was a member of Kizokuin (the House of Peers).
After the death of the 14th Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA, who acted as a guardian of Shogun's guardian, he assumed the post of the 15th Shogun of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
After the Emperor Meiji returned political power (= Taisei Hokan [transfer of power back to the Emperor]), he aimed at kobu- ⁇  ( ⁇  of the imperial court and the shogunate government]), but in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi after the Restoration of Imperial Rule, he was ordered to return to Edo-jo Castle from Edo-jo Castle and ordered the Imperial Court to hunt down and kill Edo-jo Castle and surrender Edo-jo Castle.
When he was confined to his house during the Meiji period, he devoted himself to his ⁇  and lived until the Taisho period as a prince.
Yoshinobu' is also read as 'Yoshinonobu' or 'Keiki' as his common name.
There is a record in the official documents of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) as "Yoshihisa."
Her name is also written as ' ⁇ ' in English and in English- ⁇  newspaper.
Although he is often called 'Yoshinobu' in his hometown Mito City, he is often called 'Keiki' in his childhood.
According to a person who knows Yoshinobu while he was alive, Yoshinobu himself was fond of 'Keiki-sama' and he called himself 'Keiki' to his younger brother Akitabu TOKUGAWA.
It is said that Yoshinobu's successor, ⁇  TOKUGAWA, was also called 'Keikyu-sama' by people around the same time as Yoshinobu.
Although the two names of 'Keiki-sama' and 'Keiki-san' can be confirmed in modern times, the term 'Keiki-san' is rarely found in Shizuoka Prefecture, and the term 'Keiki-san' is often used even in the case of either case.
Although there are many people who call it "Keiki" as 'there are many people related to the Kira family,' it is possible that the use of the Higo Domain members who were engaged in the anti-shogunate movement could be confirmed by the people of the Higo Domain who were involved in the anti-shogunate movement, and therefore, it is possible to think that they were ⁇  in the Battle of Yamazaki or ⁇ .
On October 29, ⁇ , he was born as the seventh son of ⁇  KUKI, the ninth lord of the Mito Domain in Edo.
His mother was Princess Yoshiko (the third Shogun Iemitsu TOKUGAWA's lawful wife), whose lawful wife was Princess Yoshiko.
However, Iemitsu's real mother is said to be Oe no kata, the legal wife of her father Hidetada, but some say that Kasuga no Tsubone was the real mother of Kasuga no Tsubone.
His childhood name was ⁇ maro.
According to the educational policy of Nariaki, ' ⁇ s are raised by the nation,' he moved to the Mito Domain for seven months after his birth, and many of his students were taught and taught martial arts and martial arts from Seisai EIZAWA and others.
He seemed to have been ⁇  by Yoshinobu at that time, and at first, Nariaki did not have an adopted child to another family, so he thought that he would remain in the care of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA, his eldest son (the eldest son) and ⁇  TOKUGAWA.
On September 1, ⁇ , an order to appoint ⁇ maro to Mito Domain was issued by the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) to succeed the Hitotsubashi family.
In response to this, ⁇ maro returned to the Hitotsubashi family on September 1, and in December, he was granted a portion of the real name of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA from the 12th Shogun Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA.
Ieyoshi often visited the Hitotsubashi residence, and thought that Yoshinobu would be an influential candidate for the Shogun's heir, but he gave up receiving advice from roju (member of shogun's council of elders) Masahiro ABE.
In 1853, during the confusion in the ⁇  of the Black Ships, Ieyoshi died of illness, and Iesada TOKUGAWA, the 13th shogun, who succeeded Ieyoshi's position as Shogun, was sickly and sickly, and there was a problem that Iesada TOKUGAWA, the 13th shogun of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), who succeeded to the position of Shogun, was 'the heir to the Shogun's position' (the issue of Shogun's heir).
The Hitotsubashi group, consisting of Nariaki TOKUGAWA and Masahiro ABE, the lord of the Satsuma domain, Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA, and Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA, the lord of the Kishu Domain, and the ⁇  group of the O-oku group, which supported Ieyoshi's real mother, Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA, and the biological mother of Iesada.
The Hitotsubashi group tried to put Tenshoin, the adopted daughter of Nariakira SHIMAZU, into O-oku (the inner halls of Edo Castle where the wife of the Shogun and her servants reside) as the Shogun's wife and the Shogun's wife, but after Masahiro ABE and Nariakira SHIMAZU died one after another, the Tairo (chief minister) Naosuke II, who became Tairo (chief minister) died one after another, made a decision to ' ⁇  the heir of Shogun Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA.'
In the same year, Naosuke II signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan without imperial sanction.
Yoshinobu, together with Nariaki, the lord of Fukui Domain, Nariaki TOKUGAWA, and others, ⁇ ed Nariaki TOKUGAWA, but in the following year, 1859, he was ordered to retire and be confined to his house (An Ansei no Taigoku).
When Yoshinobu himself did not want to become heir to the Shogun, he sent a letter to Nariaki saying 'I don't want to do it, but I have to do so since I'm failure to take the reins of the government.'
In 1860, he was suspended from office.
In 1862, Imperial envoy ⁇  ⁇ , a guard of Satsuma Domain led by Hisamitsu SHIMAZU, went to Edo and ordered Emperor Komei to appoint Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA as Shogun's guardian and appoint him as Tairo (chief minister).
On July 6, the Edo bakufu appointed Yoshinobu as the guardian of the shogun, and ⁇  ⁇  as the president of political affairs.
Yoshinobu and ⁇  implemented the reformation of the shogunate government called Bunkyu Reform, and established Kyoto ⁇  (Military governor of Kyoto) and ⁇  (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo) and ⁇  (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo).
In 1863, he went up to Kyoto as an attendant to Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA, and made an effort to negotiate with the Imperial Court against the expulsion of foreigners.
When Emperor Komei visited Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine to pray for the expulsion of foreigners by prayer for the expulsion of foreigners, the Emperor ordered Iemochi to carry out the expulsion of foreigners, saying that he would carry out the expulsion of foreigners, and he ordered Iemochi to have an audience with him.
When the Sonno Joi ha (supporters of the doctrine of restoring the emperor and expelling the barbarians) led by the Choshu clan broke out in the Coup of August 18 (old calendar), he went to Kyoto again to participate in the Sanyo-kaigi (a council of state) with the support of Kobu Gattai ( ⁇  between the imperial court and the shogunate) and the Shogunate.
However, it can be said that the conference was held by the council, and he was ⁇  in drinking parties with Imperial Prince Kuninomiya ⁇  and others, ⁇ ing ⁇ -jo Castle, ⁇ -jo Castle, ⁇ -jo Castle, ⁇ -jo Castle, and ⁇ -jo Castle, and furthermore, he tried to break up the system, saying 'I have been ⁇  by Shimazu's forces,' and furthermore, he tried to stop the government by ⁇ ing the system.
After that, he was appointed as Kinri Goshuei Sotoku (Governor-General of the Imperial Palace Guard) by the Imperial Court in Kyoto, and he was in charge of reverence for the Emperor and the expulsion of foreigners and court nobles along with ⁇  MATSUDAIRA (the lord of Aizu Domain) and ⁇  MATSUDAIRA (the lord of Kuwana Domain), and ⁇  MATSUDAIRA (the lord of Kuwana Domain) and Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA (the lord of Kuwana Domain).
During the Tenguto no Ran ( ⁇  of Tenguto), he showed his coolness to cut down the vassals of his parents and Mito Domain, including ⁇ sai TAKEDA, who supported Yoshinobu.
In 1864, the Choshu army was attacked by the army of bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) at the Kinmon Incident and attacked the Choshu army which occupied Takatsukasa's residence.
Following this, he was involved in the conquest of Choshu, and worked hard for the Imperial sanction for the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan, and succeeded in obtaining imperial sanction on the condition.
In the second conquest of Choshu in 1866, Yoshinobu received an imperial order to attack Choshu by suppressing the Satsuma Domain's ⁇ .
However, due to the rejection of the Satsuma clan's dispatch of troops to Satsuma, the bakufu army was defeated.
On August 20, during the second conquest of Choshu, Shogun Iemochi died in Osaka-jo Castle.
Yoshinobu took the Imperial Court's movement to ⁇  the imperial rescript and concluded a peace agreement.
Although Iemochi was recommended to succeed Iemochi, Yoshinobu refused this proposal.
On August 20, the Tokugawa Shogun family inherited the position of Shogun, but he refused to assume the position of Shogun.
After that, roju (member of shogun's council of elders) and other members of Roju (member of shogun's council of elders) agreed to each other, but they did not accept it, and on December 5, they became Shogun by the recommendation of the Emperor Komei.
This was because he was forced to become a shogun by selling favors, and he was ⁇  to take advantage of politics.
Yoshinobu was supported by the French minister Léon ROCHEROE, with the support of 20,000 dollars from France, and established ⁇  Seitetsusho (a trading house) and Shusensho (a government office in charge of casting and appraising of gold during the Edo period) and conducted military systems, including Jurrene Brenes Brenes.
Also, he encouraged his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA to study in Europe, such as sending his younger brother Akitaka TOKUGAWA to Paris.
At the problem of the opening of Hyogo port, the Imperial Court was given permission by the Emperor to ⁇ e the Imperial Court.
Yoshinobu, who was ⁇  to 'the secret imperial command to attack the shogunate' to the Satsuma and Choshu clans, reported to the Imperial Court on October 14, 1867 (the Taisei Hokan [transfer of power back to the Emperor]).
It is said that the Imperial Court at that time had no administrative ability, and it was said that the Tokugawa shogunate maintained its existence by leading the council of feudal lords.
However, Toshimichi OKUBO and Tomomi IWAKURA, who aimed to overthrow the Shogunate, issued an order in December, and in December, Yoshinobu was ordered to 'Jikan nochi' (resignation of resignation of Naidaijin and ⁇  of Tokugawa's territory).
Yoshinobu left Osaka-jo Castle in order to avoid conflict, provoked the ministers of foreign countries, and insisted on the Tokugawa conquest and siege of Edo-jo Castle to the Imperial Court, and also requested the Imperial Court to change the Jikan nochi.
However, in the following year, 1868, the Satsuma Domain raised an army at the Battle of Toba-Fushimi and raised an army with soldiers of Aizu and Kuwana Domain soldiers.
However, when the army of the former bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) was ⁇  in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi which broke out on January 3 (January 3 under the old lunar calendar) and the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, the army of the former bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) lost its military strength and retreated to Edo in "Kaiyo Maru" (Kaiyo Maru Warship).
Soon after, the order to track down and kill Yoshinobu as an enemy of the Imperial Court was issued, and the Imperial army, which was led by Dai Sotoku (Governor-General of the Dazai-fu [local government office in Kyushu region]), led by Dai Sotoku-fu (Commander-in-Chief of the Great Governor-General of the Dazai-fu [local government office in Kyushu region]), started the east campaign.
Yoshinobu insisted on ⁇ ing his allegiance by suppressing the resistance force led by ⁇  ⁇ .
In February, he entrusted Kaishu KATSU to take part in the situation and was ordered to be placed under house arrest in Daijiin of Ueno Kanei-ji Temple.
Also, the head of the Tokugawa family, Kamenosuke TAYASU (later Tatsunosuke TOKUGAWA) was adopted as his adopted son.
When the negotiations with the government staff officer Takamori SAIGO and the staff officer of the government army were ⁇  and the Edo-jo Castle was surrendered without blood, Yoshinobu's treatment was moved to Mito, and he stayed in the room of ⁇ -kan, a ⁇  (domain school).
In July, he moved to Sunpu where the Tokugawa family was transferred.

In 1897, he moved to Sugamo, Tokyo.
In the following year, he visited the Imperial Palace and had an audience with Emperor Meiji.

As for the study of military arts and learning, he was born in the highest environment of the martial arts and was enthusiastic about the art of warfare among various martial arts, and was a master of the art of ⁇ .
Even after the Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor), he was the most famous person among the masters of ⁇ -jutsu (art of warfare) and taught them every day.
He did not sleep well, and when his father, Imperial Princess Kazunomiya ⁇ , was sleeping in bed as a problem in the succession of the Tokugawa family, he tried to put a sword on his bedside (it is said that he was simply a threat and he was ⁇  when he saw the sword when he was sleeping).
On the other hand, there is an anecdote that when he came to sleep after his coming of age, he met his wife and two mistresses to become 'Y' with the same Chinese character as 'Y'.
Although it is said that Yoshinobu was portrayed as a photograph of Yoshinobu, it is not considered that he was a photographer in Japan at the time of Yoshinobu's young age, so it is not clear whether Yoshinobu himself was himself.
It is said that he visited Iemochi's visit to see Iemochi, who fell ill, and at that time, he was ⁇  to visit him.
He was known for his ⁇ , and ⁇  AJIMA, his biological father-in-law, praised Yoshinobu as 'Kiyotada TOKUGAWA, who cleaned the Tokugawa lineage' and assumed the position of shogun with the hope of restoring the Tokugawa shogunate, and praised him as ' ⁇  Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.'
Hideaki, who was on the side of the overthrow of the Shogunate, was a member of the pro-shogunate group, and especially Takayoshi KIDO of the Choshu clan, 'It is impossible to ⁇  Yoshinobu ⁇ 's ⁇ .
He seemed to have been watching Ieyasu again.'
In response to Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor), Ryoma SAKAMOTO said, 'Oju (Shogun) Kimiko, and today's suicide is ⁇ .
Even if you don't ⁇ , you will be able to ⁇  even if you don't accept it.
In the end, he gave an evaluation of his life for the public and tried to give Yoshinobu the position of vice chief adviser to the new government.
However, it was in the Meiji period when Yoshinobu knew that Ryoma was Ryoma's presence (after Ryoma's death).
There are no stories about Yoshinobu, and it is very interesting that Ryoma died while he was alive after the Meiji Restoration.
When he was defeated in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, he ran away to Edo and was criticized by his enemy, saying, 'The enemy's flight'.
At this time, although the seal of Kinogi ( ⁇  fans) had been handed down since the time of Ieyasu, there were some who had been in touch with Yoshinobu, who did not forget about the ⁇  of Yoshinobu's ⁇ .
However, there is also an opinion that it was necessary to resist armed uprisings in Edo and Musashi Province at that time, and because Yoshinobu became an enemy of the Emperor, there was no way to fight against foreign countries in order to prevent the ⁇  of Osaka-jo Castle, even if Yoshinobu became the enemy of the enemy.
It is said that he was highly regarded as the Emperor's enemy by the new government or because he was confined to Kanei-ji Temple, or because he was in confinement at Kanei-ji Temple (it is thought that he was influenced by Mitogaku (the scholarship and academic traditions that arose in the Mito Domain) and his mother was from the Imperial Family), but he didn't show his respect to his lord as ' ⁇ ' because he didn't respond to his master.
Due to the fact that he was forced to transfer the government to the government while he was in a state close to the bloodless revolution, he was highly evaluated for his achievement in the Restoration.
 ⁇  ⁇ , a businessman, was employed as a retainer when he was the head of the Hitotsubashi-Tokugawa family, and after the Meiji Restoration, he was promoted to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade).
In the last years of Yoshinobu's life, ⁇  wrote ' ⁇  Dream-e' to ⁇  Yoshinobu's biography, in which he heard about Yoshinobu's ⁇ .
"Konjaku Yume no ⁇ " is a collection of ⁇ s.
According to the chapter in the form of a part-time meeting, it can be seen that the voice of Yoshinobu in the wedding ceremony can be seen.
It can be said that his character and heart of the time can be seen in the fact that he was a person who did not like him when he was still a child, and he was ⁇  by the words, 'I don't like ⁇ ,' 'I don't like you,' and 'I am a ⁇  person.'
Based on these materials, " ⁇  Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA Koki" was completed after Yoshinobu's death.
When he was pardoned as the Emperor's enemy, he expressed his will to express his gratitude to the Emperor Meiji, who was given the highest rank of the peerage, and therefore, Yoshinobu ordered his funeral to be held in a Shinto ceremony rather than a Buddhist ceremony.
For this reason, the grave of Yoshinobu was not in the graveyard of the Tokugawa family in ⁇ -ji Temple, which was the family temple of the Tokugawa family, and a similar round ⁇  was built in Taninaka Reien.
This was due to the ⁇  of the imperial mausoleum of Emperor Komei (according to "Koyo ⁇  Koki" (Diary of Yoshinobu ⁇ )).
After the pardon, Katsukiyo ⁇ , roju (member of shogun's council of elders) at that time, expressed his regret for Yoshinobu's life without worrying about his life, saying, 'It is regrettable that Yoshinobu should act together with Yoshinobu.'
There was an image of a weak person in ' ⁇ mae' in the Battle of Nagashino, but after Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor), it has been re ⁇  in recent years, and there is a movement to re ⁇  Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA (NHK Historical Drama) in addition to the TV program.
Like his father Nariaki, he liked pork in Satsuma Domain, and was called ⁇  Ichisama ( ⁇ -sama, pork and pork were fondly fond of ⁇ -bashi Bridge).
In his later years, he was interested in Western literary works, and he seemed to have been interested in painting, fishing, microorganisms, microorganisms, ⁇ s, and tegeis ( ⁇ s) when he was a shogun, but this was not well known.
He is famous as a ⁇ man, but it seems that he didn't follow the technique of shooting.
He often contributed to the magazine, but it is said that he was not able to use it.
His great-grandchild, ⁇  TOKUGAWA, was also freelancer, and his photograph taken by Yoshinobu was found in the house of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA and edited and edited it.
His younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA was a friend of his ⁇ .
On December 3, 1855, he changed his name to ⁇  ICHIJO (he changed his name to Yoshiko MIGA after the Meiji Restoration).
She and Biga were born on July 16, 1858, but she died young on July 20, 1858.
Since then, he had no children with ⁇ , and in the Meiji period, his tenth son, 11 daughters, who were born between two concubines, were all born.
The couple included the seventh son, Ieyoshi, who succeeded to the Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA family, the tenth son, and the tenth son, ⁇ , who became the adopted son-in-law of Kaishu KATSU, and the ninth daughter, Tsuneko, who became the wife of Fushiminomiya Hiroyasu.

▁Note
Nara Line is a railway ( ⁇ ) operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West) from Kizu Station (Kyoto Prefecture) on the Uji Line to Kyoto Station on the Uji Line of the West Japan Railway Company (JR West).
The entire line is included in the suburban section of the metropolitan area.
Because it's a terminal station on the Kansai Main Line, its official starting point is Kizu Station, but the trains running from Kyoto to Kizu Station arrive at and depart from Kyoto Station (the number of trains is odd), and the inbound train makes up the inbound train (the number of trains is odd).
Except for the detailed data, it will be described in the direction of Kizu from Kyoto to Kizu.
Its selection is green tea, and the reason why the selection is said to be 'a ⁇  image of the old capital connecting two ancient capitals.'
The jurisdiction ( ⁇  type): West Japan Railway Company ( ⁇  operator)
Route distance (operation kilometers): 34.7▁km
Track gauge: ⁇ ▁mm
Number of stations: 19 (including the starting and terminal stations)
 ⁇ -track section: Shinden - Uji section, JR ⁇  - Kyoto▁section
 ⁇ ed section: entire line (DC 1500V)
 ⁇  ( ⁇ ) system: A ⁇  block system (track section) and a single track automatic block system (track section)
 ⁇  device: A ⁇  Train Stop▁system
Operation center: Shin-Osaka General Control▁Center
M ⁇  speed: ⁇  km/h, ⁇  km/h (track section)
Except for Kizu Station, this station is under the jurisdiction of the Kyoto branch of the West Japan Railway Company (Kizu Station is managed by the Osaka Branch Office of West Japan Railway Company).
As the name of the line, the line between Kyoto and Kizu is named Nara Line, but the entire line is located in Kyoto Prefecture, and there is no railway line in Nara Prefecture.
This was due to the process of separating the section from Kizu to Nagoya as a part of the Osaka - Nagoya route after the Kansai Railway was merged into Kansai Railway Company, but the section between Osaka and Nagoya was separated as part of the Kansai Railway Company.
However, trains run from Kizu Station to Nara Station on the Kansai Main Line (Yamatoji Line) and arrive at Nara Station in Nara Prefecture.
JR West established the nickname of the line (JR Kyoto Line, JR Kobe Line and so on) in accordance with the revision of March 13, 1988, but the Nara Line was ⁇ .
Since Kintetsu Nara Line is located in Kintetsu Nara Line, it is sometimes referred to as 'JR Nara Line.'
In the era of Japan National Railways ( ⁇ ), it was called ' ⁇  Nara Line of Japan National Railways,' and the English letter 'JNR' was also added to the announcement board.
Kintetsu Nara Line is related to the Yamatoji Line between Nanba Station and Nara Station, and the Kintetsu Nara Line is on the Kintetsu Kyoto Line, which is operated by the JR Nara Line.
While many trains on the Kintetsu Kyoto Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line had been operated in parallel before the electrification of the Nara Line until 1984 in the end of the JNR era, trains on the Nara Line weren't electrified, and even after the electrification of the JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series ⁇ , two cars of JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series 105 were used for a while.
However, after JR West was established, this line was incorporated into the Urban Network, and some trains were upgraded to four-car trains (some of them were six-car trains), a double-track section became a double-track section and a double-track section became a double-track section, and rapid trains such as rapid trains such as the ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' ( ⁇ ji Rapid Service) were improved.
Today, the characteristics of commuters and ⁇ s from the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture such as Uji City Byodo-in Temple in Uji City, and Kumiyama-cho, Uji City, Kyoto Prefecture.
However, it is largely divided into the east side of Momoyama Station and Shinden Station, and in the south of Joyo City, the Kintetsu Kyoto Line, which runs in the south of Joyo City, runs in parallel with the urban area of Joyo City, is still in use.
The rolling stock of the Nara Train Depot, a branch of the Osaka Branch, is used, but the station facilities are managed by the Kyoto branch office except for Kizu Station.
J- ⁇  cards, Suica of East Japan Railway Company (JR East), ⁇  of Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) and PiTaPa of KANSAI  ⁇  ⁇  can be used at all stations.
In the south of Joyo Station, a simple ticket gate is provided for convenience.
Since the 'Kuroshio (train)' connected to the Nara Line, Sakurai Line and Wakayama Line was discontinued in 1984, local trains had been operated until 1991 (as a limited express train was temporarily operated for a certain period of time), but currently four types of rapid trains, rapid trains and local trains, local trains, local trains, local trains, local trains, and local trains are operated.
This is the highest type of train operated on the Nara Line, and it is operated mainly in the daytime.
Basically, local trains and local trains make a connection with local trains and local trains at 30 minutes.
The nickname ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' was chosen by the general public before the timetable was revised.
As a sightseeing train connecting Kyoto and Nara, it is often used by foreigners not only by Japanese but also by foreigners.
The rolling stock of the JR (West) ⁇  Train Series 221 is operated by four-car trains or six-car trains.
Rapid trains run at ⁇  km/h on the Sanyo Shinkansen line, and at ⁇  km/h on the Sanyo Shinkansen line, the maximum speed is ⁇  km/h.
The standard time is approximately 44 minutes from Kyoto Station to Nara Station, and approximately 47 minutes from Nara Station.
The trains bound for Kyoto stop at Kamikoma Station or Tanakura Station on the way to Kyoto and arrive at the Miyakoji Rapid Service on the Nara route, which is different from the Miyakoji Rapid Service on the Nara route, so there are slightly differences between the inbound and outbound trains and outbound trains.
During the New Year's holidays, a special express train stopped at Inari Station for the purpose of visiting ⁇ -taisha Shrine.
▁History
March 3, 2001: The operation started.
March 15, 2003: With the timetable revision, trains began to stop at Tofuku-ji Station and Tamamizu Station.
It is operated during the rush hour during the rush hour.
This stop also stops at JR Ogura Station and Shinden Station (Kyoto Prefecture) where the ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' runs.
The rolling stock used on the Nara Electric Railway Series ⁇  was operated by four-car trains or six-car trains.
Basically, local trains and local trains make a connection with local trains and local trains at 30 minutes.
Like the Miyakoji Rapid Service mentioned above, there is a stop at Narayama Station where rapid trains on the Yamatoji Line stop.
Until March 2001, ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' was introduced, and JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series ⁇  was used in Kyoto, Uji, Joyo ( ⁇  at first) and Nara, and JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series 113 was used in the Nara Line, but after that, JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series ⁇  wasn't used.
There is a train that directly connects to the Yamatoji Line in order to operate trains on the Osaka Loop Line.
It is operated mainly in the morning and at night.
Initially, this train was operated only on weekdays but was also operated on ⁇  and holidays from March 18, 2006 to March 18,▁2006.
Although the trains between Uji Station and Uji Station used to run on the Uji Line at the end of the night, in the past there was a plan to drive local trains from Kizu Station to Kizu Station, but at present the local trains running in front of Ibarakishi Station were changed to the terminal timetable.
One of the trains that start from Kyoto Station on ⁇  and holidays are operated with the JR (West) ⁇  Train Series ⁇ , all of which are operated on the ⁇  and holidays.
There is a direct train from the Yamatoji Line to the Yamatoji Line in order to operate trains on the Osaka Loop Line.
The trains on the Nara Line used the color of the same color as ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' or ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' on the Yamatoji Line, but due to the revision of the timetable revision made in March 2008, the color of the trains on the Nara Line ceased to be used with green letters.
It is described in Shijimon ( ⁇  characters) on the front of Kamikoma Station.
It is operated between Kyoto Station, Uji Station, Joyo Station and Kameoka Station.
During the daytime, the route between Kyoto Station and Joyo Station was operated every 15 minutes, but the section between Joyo Station and Kizu Station became 30 minutes.
Basically, trains run on the 103 series and run on the 103 series, but some of them are operated by the ⁇  series.
Some trains run directly to the Yamatoji Line in the early morning and late in the morning and late at night.
In the past, the Nara Line and Sakurai Line were divided in line with the Sakurai Line, but on September 4, 1994, the Nara Line and the Sakurai Line were divided.
Although it is unmanned, trains on the Nara Line sometimes run on the Nara Line.
From 1987 to 1988, the nickname 'Kuroshio' (train) and 'Kuroshio (train)' (train) ran between Kyoto Station and Hakuhama Station via the Kansai Main Line, Hanwa Line, Hanwa Line, Hanwa Line and Hanwa Line from 1988 to 1989.
On January 6, 1998, in the Kinki edition of the timetable revision made on January 6, 1998, the operation of the limited express trains on the Nara Line was announced, but the plan was later cancelled.
There was a time when the Miyakoji Rapid Service was operated between Kyoto Station and Sakurai Station (between Kyoto Station and Nara Station, Rapid Service trains ran on the Miyakoji Line), but now no special express trains to the Sakurai Line, including the special rapid trains, have been operated.
During mid-August, the Uji-gawa River Flower Festival, which is the nearest destination to the Uji-gawa River, is operated every special schedule until the end of the 16th timetable, because it's impossible to secure transportation capacity, all of the local trains have been operated only for 10 minutes since the 16th century, and after the 16th century, all trains are operated between Kyoto Station and Uji Station.
Some local trains arrive at and depart from Kizu Station.
The timetable of March 3 at that time was a special schedule for a single single track, and Rapid trains were operated between Kyoto Station and Uji Station, as well as the frequency of operation between Uji Station and Uji Station.
Depending on the year, some trains began making stops at Momoyama Station.
Around 1992, special rapid service was extended to Sakurai Line, mainly on ⁇  and holidays, and one hour was operated between Tenri Station and Tenri Station.
In addition, the trains that are exclusively operated exclusively for groups throughout Japan are sometimes sometimes operated.
In particular, when the Tenrikyo ⁇ tai on October 26 every year, trains called 'group-only train-cars on the Tenri Line' come from Kyoto Station to Tenri Station via the Nara Line, Kizu Station on the Nara Line, Yamatoji Line, Nara Station, Nara Station and Sakurai Line.
All of them belong to Nara Train Depot.
JR West ⁇  Train Series<unk>
There are two types of cars, four-car trains and six-car trains on the Yamatoji Line and the Osaka Loop Line.
It is mainly used for ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' and ' ⁇  Rapid Service' as well as four-car trains, but four-car trains on the Nara Line mainly use the four-car trains on the Nara Line.
Two-car trains and two-car trains can be seen on holidays.
JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series▁103
Rapid trains of the Nara Line, which are used for local trains on the Nara Line, are operated not only on the Nara Line but on the Nara Line, but also on the Osaka Loop Line and the Yamatoji Line during the rush hour on the Yamatoji Line.

Keiji Bypass (Keiji Bypass, Anglo-PSSSSSSSSS) is a general Bypass that extends from Kusatsu City, Shiga Prefecture to Kumiyama Town, Kuse County, Kyoto Prefecture.
It is designated as a plan for local high- ⁇  highways.
The Keiji Bypass, which is operated by the Keiji Bypass, is explained below, and the Keiji Bypass of the Keiji Bypass of the National Highway Route No. 1 and 24 of the National Route 24 will be explained below.
It is connected with Meishin Expressway, and connects with Meishin Expressway in Otsu City and Kyoto City, and connects to ⁇  Interchange of Meishin Expressway, Nagoya City, and ⁇  Interchange and Osaka City.
Based on the law, the Seta Higashi Interchange and the Kumiyama- ⁇  Interchange are based on National Route 1 and 478, while the Kumiyama- ⁇  Interchange (Keiji Bypass) and the Kumiyama- ⁇  Interchange are based on National Highway Route No. 478, based on National Highway Route No. 478, and Kumiyama- ⁇  Interchange (Kyoto ⁇  Expressway), and the Kumiyama-cho Interchange is a high- ⁇  highway ( ⁇  Expressway) which is designated by the Minister of Land, ⁇ , Transport and Tourism, and Tourism (National Highway Road ⁇  Expressway).
In the later plan, the construction of roads with the ⁇  of Meishin Expressway and the construction of the Kyoto L ⁇  Expressway, connecting Kyoto Tanba Road and Keiji Bypass, which were the National Highway Route No. 9, and Kyoto Outer R ⁇  Expressway was built.
The National Route 478 and the Kyoto Second Outer R ⁇  Expressway have been designated as National Highway Route No. 478, and the maintenance of the road has been maintained.
Based on the indication of the route, it is said that Keiji Bypass is a Keiji Bypass at Seta Higashi-Maizuru Station and Oyamazaki Station on the Keihan Uji Line.
Also, there is no difference between the Meishin Expressway and the Keiji Bypass via either routes or the ETC discount system.
In this section, when there is no special mention, Keiji Bypass (from Seta Higashi Interchange to Oyamazaki Station) is described as a business operator.

The Uji Tunnel of this route, which has a long National Route 113 and 313 meters, is prohibited except for the buses of Uji Higashi Interchange and Kasatori Interchange in the tunnel, except for 500 meters in front of the Kasatori Interchange.
Prior to the opening of the Kumiyama ⁇ , the film "THEVE IIDEL II Bridge" was shot in the movie before the opening.
The distance from the Setahigashi Interchange to the Oyamazaki Interchange is shorter than that of the Meishin Expressway, and when the Keiji Bypass runs parallel to the Meishin Expressway, the route of the Keiji Bypass is longer than that of the Meishin Expressway.
Because there are no ⁇  facilities such as services in the service area, there are many cases where the Meishin Expressway is more expensive than the Meishin Expressway (there are two ⁇ s in the Otsu Service Area and the Katsuragawa ⁇  Area).
However, due to the fact that the structure of both the Seta Higashi and Oyamazaki stations were built after the god's name (especially the structure of the Oyamazaki ⁇  Line), the operation was reduced by the LD system ( ⁇  Expressway).
There is an opinion that if you go from Oyamazaki Station to ⁇  Station or arrive at the left side of Meishin Expressway, you may join the Meishin Expressway.
Also, there are many ⁇ s and slopes on the way, so it's impossible to function as a ⁇  for Meishin Expressway because there are many ⁇ s on the way.
This road is a ⁇  for motor vehicles because it is a ⁇  of National Highway Route No. 1 (National Highway) and is not a high-speed drive route.
If you go from the east side of the Uji-gawa River to the Keiji Bypass of ⁇  and Kumiyama-cho, you must go to the west of Uji-nishi Interchange.
This is because the Ujihigashi Interchange is a ⁇ .
Therefore, the section between Ujihigashi Interchange and Ujinishi Interchange is often used for commuter hours.
Because this general road section isn't underpassing, it is difficult to avoid ⁇ .

Higashi Hongan-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) located in Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.
It is the head temple of the Otani school of the Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) which is one of the groups of Shinshu sect (the 10 schools of the Shinshu sect) and is the head temple of Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) along with Nishi Hongan-ji Temple (the formal name of the head temple of the Hongan-ji Temple).
The formal name of the temple was 'Hongan-ji Temple' until 1987 and 'Shin Shinshu Honbyo' after that.
It is often called 'Ohigashi-san' in order to distinguish it from Nishi Hongan-ji Temple located in Shimogyo Ward.
(For details, refer to the history before the separation of Buddhism into east and west, refer to the history of Hongan-ji Temple.)
The 12th head priest of Hongan-ji Temple, Shonyo (Mitsuju), was given a temple estate in the east of Hongan-ji Temple by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, and Hongan-ji Temple was built in 1602 when Hongan-ji Temple was split into two.
Located in the present Karasuma Shichijo, Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City, Higashi Hongan-ji Temple came to be called Higashi Hongan-ji Temple because it stands on the east side of Nishi Hongan-ji Temple located on Horikawa-shichijo.
In 1987, Hongan-ji Temple as a religious corporation that had a relationship with Otani-ha (group of Otani-ha) and ⁇  (group of Buddhist priests) was dissolved, and it was integrated into a religious sect.
After that, the formal name of Higashi Hongan-ji Temple was 'Jodo Shinshu Honbyo' (Honbyo Mausoleum) (Honbyo Mausoleum) which was followed by the believers of the sect who accompanied Shinran to preach the teachings of Shinran.
It is also said that the Higashi Hongan-ji school of Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) and the Higashi Hongan-ji school of Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) separated from the sect and insisted on legitimacy.

Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is a god (Shinto) appearing in Japanese Mythology.
In "Engishiki" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), it is called 'Amateruteru' in case of ⁇ -jinja Shrine as a natural god.
It is a godification of the sun and is considered to be one of the ancestors of the Imperial Family (Kososhin).
In "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), it is written as Amatsu ⁇  no kami or Amaterasu Omikami in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan).
It is also called Oohirume no michi no kami.
In "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), more than one gods are described, but in "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), they are unified under the name of 'Tenshodai okami.'
Although she is a goddess, there is another theory that she was actually a male god.
As the name of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is used in political parts such as "Kotai Jingu ⁇ cho" ( ⁇  of the Ceremonies for Kotai-jingu Shrine) and so on, there is a theory that ⁇  was originally the ancestral deity of the Three Shrines in the Imperial Court (Komusubi no mikoto) and Nishi ⁇  no mikoto was the ancestor of the Imperial Family and became Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
In Ise-jingu Shrine, it is usually called Amatsumara okami or Sume oomikami, and it is also called Amatsu kami okami no kami when chanting a name before a Shinto ritual.
Today, 'Takama' and 'Katakana' are extant in academic documents.
There is also a theory that it was written as 天 ⁇ 神 in ancient times.
Descriptions in▁mythology
According to "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), when Izanagi returned from the land of Izanami and washed ⁇ , he was born when he washed his left eye when he washed ⁇ .
At this time, she was called ⁇  no Mikoto, along with her right eye and nose, and she was called ⁇ ko.
At that time, Izanagi gave instructions to Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) to Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
Susanoo, who had been entrusted with the sea, was exiled by Izanagi because he had been ⁇ ing that he wanted to go to the land of Izanami.
Susanoo met his older sister Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) before the conquest of Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains), but Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) thought that his younger brother, Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) would come to Takamanohara (plain of high heaven), and he was given an armed force.
In order to ⁇  Susano's ⁇ , five male gods were born from the real world of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and three goddesses were born from Susano's real fruit, and Susano won the victory.
Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) was born from the realities of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) was regarded as the following five gods.
Amenooshihomimimi
Amenohohi
Amatsuhikone
Irihikone
Kumanokusubi
Susanoo, who was ⁇  by this, worked for Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains) in Takamanohara (plain of high heaven), and as a result, Amaterasu Omikami hid herself in Ashihara no ⁇  ( ⁇  Land of Reed Plains).
 ⁇  became apparent, and various misfortunes occurred.
Yaoyorozu no Mikoto, the god of Chichibu, and Ame no M ⁇  no Mikoto, the god of Ashihara no ⁇ , succeeded in driving Amaterasu Omikami from the rock cave, and Susano was exiled from Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).
Ame no M ⁇  no Mikoto sent his son, Amenooshihomi to ⁇  Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains).
After ⁇  no Mikoto was suppressed, ⁇  no kami (the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess) tried to ⁇  Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains), but Ninigi (the Sun Goddess) gave birth to Ninigi (the Sun Goddess) Ninigi (the grandson of the sun goddess).
The▁interpretation
In the mythology, there is a view that Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) worshiped the gods by performing religious services (matsurigoto) in accordance with the instructions of the Emperor ⁇ , who was born earlier than him, and therefore, there is a view that Amaterasu Omikami was a ⁇  of the emperor itself.
There is also an opinion that it is a ⁇  of ancient shrine maiden.
Another name 'Hirume' is 'Hime no Onna' and it refers to a shrine maiden serving the sun god.
Although the sun god is originally a male god, there is a theory that a shrine maiden serving it was identified with the sun god and became a goddess.
There is also a theory that this goddess was established during the reign of Empress Jito, or that Himiko was a model for Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
It is pointed out that the birth of 'moku' of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and Tsukuyomi no kami (the Sun Goddess) in the sun and Tsukuyomi no kami (the sun god of the moon) is described in "Reiho Gofu" ( ⁇  of Five Articles) ( ⁇  century) ( ⁇  the sixth century) of Taoism and "Kyoho Gofu" ( ⁇  of the Five Classics of Confucianism and Buddhism), and in "Keiho-kyo" ( ⁇  of ⁇ ) ( ⁇  of ⁇ ) ( ⁇  of ⁇ ) ( ⁇  of ⁇ ) it is pointed out that it was strongly influenced by Dokyo.
Additionally, it is said that the conception of the shrines and the shrines of Ise-jingu Shrine, such as Ise-jingu Shrine, Ise-jingu Shrine, Saigu-no-miya Shrine, ⁇ -no-Miya, ⁇ -no- ⁇ , ⁇ -no- ⁇ , ⁇ -no- ⁇ , ⁇ -no- ⁇ , ⁇ -no- ⁇ , ⁇ -no- ⁇ , ⁇ -no-Miya, and ⁇ -jinja Shrine, is associated with the concept of Kotai-jingu Shrine.
Based on the comparison, it is pointed out that the myth of the birth of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is almost equal to the Banko myth, which was recorded in ancient times (the third to fourth century).
Also, there is a theory that the myth of Tsukuyomi, which is the month of his eyes, spread throughout Asia, is a myth that it was introduced to Japan along with the races of the preceding periods.
According to one theory, in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), ⁇  transformed into three stages.
The following is a summary of the events and contents.
 ⁇ : The Taika Reforms were revised.
Before this, the Imperial Family did not follow Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
Hinokami' (the sun god) itself is called 'Hinokami' (the sun god).
The male god who was called 'Ateruteru' is widely known.
In "Engishiki" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), there are shrines with the pronunciation of 'Amateru-jinja Shrine' in Tsushima as well as 'Amateru-jinja Shrine' in Tanba, 'Amateru-jinja Shrine' in Harima.
Incidentally, Amenomateru is another name for Amenohoakari, a grandson of Amaterasu, and Amenohoakari is the earliest ancestor of the Owari clan, Tsumori clan and Kaibe clan.
Also, the younger brother of Amenohokari is Ninigi, who is the grandson of Emperor Jinmu.
672: Jinshin▁War
It is also called 'Ohirume no michi' (literally, 'a woman who worships the sun god') or 'a woman who worships the sun god'.
In this case, there are two interpretations: one is that the enshrined deity is Ohiru, and the other is that it is 'Ateru' of the male god of snake.
 ⁇ : The Kotai-jingu Shrine was built.
She is 'the ancestor of Amaterasu' and 'the ancestor of the Imperial Family.'
She is a goddess.
It was created as a model for Empress Jito, and was created as a humanized god by nature.
After that, 'Tenteru' other than the Kososhin was called 'Amateruteru.'
For example, in "Shinsen ⁇ " (Newly ⁇  Register of Clan Names and Titles of ⁇ ) (around 1060), the part of 'Amateru' is read as 'Amateru no Kami' and the part of 'Amateruhiko no Mikoto' in "Sendai ⁇ " (Ancient Japanese History).
1880-1881: Controversy in Shinto circles over the enshrined deity of the Shinto ⁇  Shrine, which was established in ⁇ , Tokyo.
Shinto ⁇  insisted that 'Izumo school' should be united with 'Yugen ichinyo' and 'Yugen no kami' as the enshrined deities enshrined in the shrine's shrine, and Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) as well as ' ⁇  no kami' (the God of the Land of Reed Plains) as ' ⁇  no kami' (the God of Fire) and ' ⁇  no kami' (the God of ⁇ ).
However, 'Ise-ha' (Ise school) which was the center of Shinto ⁇  was 'Tenchi Dai ⁇ ' (Great ⁇  of Heaven and Earth) presiding over the both worlds, and other gods opposed the idea of syncretization of Shinto with other subjects.
In the end, there were various theories, such as ' ⁇ -ha (the Izumo school) ⁇  the ⁇  of the ⁇  years from the age of the gods,' 'I should kill Senke-son Fuku, who had been ⁇  in the Imperial Family,' and so on.
Before long, this dispute was settled by the Emperor Meiji's decision (the Izumo faction was defeated) and the ⁇  of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) became the highest rank.
It is said that the government recognized the possibility of the creation of the creed system common in Shinto and that it was impossible to control the common people directly by the Fukko Shinto theory.
See the dispute on the enshrined deity of ⁇  Shinto Shrine.
 ⁇  ⁇  used another name, 'Ohiruchimuchi' when he appeared in his novel.
This is due to the fact that the term ' ⁇  Omikami' (the Sun Goddess) comes from the fact that the ancestor gods appear in the text, so the sun god and the god of nature appear in the text, and the sun god is also called '大日 ⁇ 神' (the great sun god).
In fact, in the novel by ⁇  ⁇ , there is a description that he was not able to judge the ⁇ , the Battle of Nagashino, the Battle of Nagashino, and the Battle of Nagashino.
Masaatsu YASUOKA (1898 - 1983) who established Konkei Gakuin Gakko (Kokkei Inc.) said, 'There is a belief in Amaterasu Omikami in Japan.
Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is the ideal of ⁇ ing the world by the Japanese spirit.
In this way, Izanami and Izanagi stated that 'iza' in 'iza' is the ideal of the world's ⁇ , the pioneers of the world, and the pioneers of the world.'
Shrines that enshrine Amaterasu▁Omikami
The shrines that enshrine Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) are called ⁇ -jinja Shrines throughout the country, but the main shrine is Naiku (inner shrine) of Ise-jingu Shrine ( ⁇ -jingu Shrine).
Kotai-daijingu Shrine is one of the Three Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family that enshrines Yata no Kagami (also known as Yata no Kagami), one of the Three Sacred Treasures of Japan.
Most of the shrines throughout Japan enshrine the Shinsatsu (Daijingu taima) of Kotai-jingu Shrine (Amateru-Daijingu Shrine).
Daimyo (Japanese territorial lord) is a term that refers to the lord of a daimyo (Japanese feudal lord).
It also refers to a person who has a great name.
The name "tsuitoshi" is a small name.
It originally referred to the people who had power in the provinces.
Among them, in the samurai society, it became the word meaning a samurai who owned many territories and subordinates.
In the Muromachi period, shugo (provincial constables) strengthened their control over their territory and became shugo daimyo (shugo, which were Japanese provincial military governors, that became daimyo, which were Japanese feudal lords).
During the Sengoku period (period of warring states) (period of warring states), a large feudal lord who established chigyo- ⁇  ( ⁇  governed by provincial government office) appeared and was called Kokujin (local samurai) or Sengoku daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period).
During the Edo period, the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) gave shoryo (territory) of more than 10,000 koku (approximately 1.8 million liters of crop yield) to the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
Among samurai with a stipend of less than 10,000 koku, samurai under the direct control of the bakufu were called jikisan.
Since feudal lords share the character of feudal lords in common with lords in China, they were treated as daimyo (Japanese feudal lords) by ⁇ ing feudal lords.
This section describes the details of the early-modern daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) in the Edo period.
Refer to the section on shugo daimyo (shugo, which were Japanese provincial military governors, that became daimyo, which were Japanese feudal lords) and Sengoku daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period).
 ⁇ -ji▁Temple
Karoku (hereditary stipend) during the Edo period was determined according to Kakaku (family status), official court rank, kokudaka (crop yield), yakuryo ( ⁇  of crop yield), and yakuseki ( ⁇  rank).
Firstly, due to the relationship with the Tokugawa Shogun family, it was classified into the Oie family (Shinpan, Shinpan daimyo), Fudai daimyo (hereditary vassals of the Tokugawa family) who had been vassals of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara, Fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) and Fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) who were mainly vassals of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara.
The first shogun, Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, in order to maintain the existence of the Shogun family, was allowed to keep the existence of the Tokugawa family, ⁇ ing the control of daimyo throughout the country, and ⁇ ing the meaning of the Tokugawa family, and in addition to the Shogun family, he appointed Yoshinao TOKUGAWA, the ninth son, to the Owari Domain, and Yorifusa TOKUGAWA, the eleventh son, to the Kishu Domain and the Mito Domain, respectively.
In addition, Ieyasu appointed Hideyasu YUKI, the second son of the second Shogun Hidetada TOKUGAWA, to the Echizen Domain, as well as daimyo (feudal lord) of the Tokugawa family all over the country.
In addition, fudai daimyo (hereditary vassals to the Tokugawa family) who established the Tokugawa Shogun family for generations were appointed to Fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) as fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) as fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family), and in order to secure military power of the bakufu, they were appointed to important posts centered around Tairo (chief councilor of state) of the bakufu (chief councilor of state) in the beginning of roju (member of shogun's council of elders) in Edo bakufu (member of shogun's council of elders).
Fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) were relatively low, and fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family), such as the Torii clan, the ⁇ bara clan, the Honda clan, the Honda clan, and the Ogasawara clan, were relatively large, but in the Edo period, fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) with a stipend of more than 100,000 koku, including the Sakai clan, the Abe clan, the ⁇  clan, the ⁇  clan, the ⁇  clan and the Toda clan, the Toda clan, the Toda clan, the Toda clan, the Toda clan, the Toda clan, the Toda clan, and the Toda clan.
This became the reason for separation of power and military power.
The tozama daimyo (nonhereditary feudal lord) after the Battle of Sekigahara were subordinate daimyos, and many of them were opposed to the Tokugawa family in the Battle of Sekigahara.
For this reason, the ⁇  of the bakufu was strong and actively engaged in ⁇  activities, and if there were fears of ⁇  or rebellions, they were strictly punished by being deprived of their territories.
Among the major tozama daimyo, there were many tozama daimyo (nonhereditary feudal lords) such as the Kaga Domain, the Satsuma Domain, the Satsuma Domain, the Sendai Domain, the Sendai Domain, the Sendai Domain, the Sendai Domain, the Kira clan, the Mori clan, the Uesugi clan, the Uesugi clan, the Yonezawa Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Tosa Yamauchi clan, the Tosa Yamauchi clan, and the Akita Domain.
In addition, the status of daimyo was divided according to the status of "daimyo" (feudal lord) or "daimyo" (lord of a castle) whose territory was more than one province or more, "joshu daimyo" (lord chamberlain) who had a castle, "joshu" ( ⁇ ) or "joshu" ( ⁇ ) who had a castle, and "joshu" ( ⁇ ) whose castle was not allowed to enter the castle, and the daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) were allowed to participate in the Edo-jo Castle.
For details, refer to the section on ⁇ seki.
The daimyo (Japanese territorial lord) leveled the level of the daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) level, and most daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) with 100,000 koku (a unit of volume: rice 1-koku is 180.39 liter, lumber 1-koku is 180.39 liter, lumber 1-koku is 0.278 cubic meter) possessed territories and their territories were located around the castle town.
In the case of dynastic nation-state, one village was divided into another feudal lord and the other feudal lord ( ⁇ kyu).
Daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) had more than 10,000 koku in principle, but the Kirengawa Domain of the ⁇  clan was 5,000 koku.
This is because the ⁇  clan was descended from the Ashikaga clan.
Daimyo were controlled by the bakufu by the system of ⁇  (three privileged branches of Tokugawa family) and ⁇  (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo).
In addition, daimyo were always in financial difficulties because they were ordered to protect coastal areas during the Edo period or in the end of the Edo period.

In " ⁇ yoshu" (a dictionary compiled in the Muromachi period), a dictionary compiled in the Muromachi period, two sounds of 'taimei' and 'daimyo' were used, and the former indicated the meaning of Shugo (provincial constable) (Daisho) and the latter was  ⁇ mochi (Fuyuso).
In the Sengoku period (period of warring states), it is said that the distinction between the meanings of syllables became ⁇ , and it was often called 'taimei' (taimei).
In the early 17th century, two sounds of 'daimyo' and 'taimei' were also published in the Japanese- ⁇  dictionary, but the distinction between words was not clear and the distinction between words was not clear, and the two were regarded as a major feudal lord.
The reason why the word 'daimyo' came to be commonly used in the Kansei Reforms was from the Kansei Reforms, and during the Kansei era, it was called 'Myomyo.'
