Umekoji Steam ⁇  Museum is an exhibition facility for steam locomotives managed by West Japan Railway Company (JR West) in Kankiji-cho, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.
On October 10, 1972, it was opened to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Japan's opening of Japan National Railways ( ⁇ ) to commemorate the opening of Japan National Railways ( ⁇ ), and it was the first facility to preserve steam locomotives as precious cultural properties and preserve them.
JR West succeeded to JR West after the division and privatization of JNR in 1987.
This facility itself is an active car base (Umekoji ⁇  Operation Center) and has been ⁇ ed and tested by JNR/JR ⁇  Train ⁇  and diesel locomotives owned by the Sagano Scenic Railway.
In the first place, this facility started to be established, and steam locomotives rapidly disappeared from the latter half of the 1960s.
At first, because it was close to Kashihara City, Tochigi Prefecture, it was the most likely candidate for the ⁇ -ku Ward, which was located in Oyama Station, Tochigi Prefecture, but it was decided that 'the area around the central part of Japan' and that Umekoji-ku Ward (at that time) was officially selected as a Preservation District for preservation of Historic Buildings.
As a general rule, the existing cars for the maintenance of the cars were ⁇  to select the existing oldest cars (one- ⁇  machine), but there were some cars that were not expected to be preserved at first, such as C6262 model No.2.
The facility consists of the "Rose exhibition house" which uses a fan-shaped structure and a transfer platform of the former Umekoji-ku Ward, and the "Conques Exhibition Hall" which was reconstructed and restored by the former Nijo Station building.
A Sensu-type ⁇  was made of reinforced concrete built in 1914, and it was designated as a national important cultural property along with a five-treduction ⁇  (completed in 1915) and a pullerail.
In 2004, it was selected as a civil engineering worker for civil engineering selection of civil engineering.
In 2006, the old Nijo Station ( ⁇  Exhibition Hall), the Ogi-type train-car train-car train-cars, the one-car train-car train-car train-cars, the one-car train-car train-cars, and the repairs were designated as a special railway- ⁇  railway- ⁇  railway.
The former Nijo station building was built in 1904 by the oldest two-storey Japanese-style Japanese-style house, which was built by Kyoto Electric Railway as the head office building, and was built in front of Heian-jingu Shrine in consideration of the landscape.
Kyoto Electric Railway was ⁇  in 1907 and subsequently used as a station for the JR ⁇  Station and then JR ⁇  Station; however, in 1996 it was completed as a station house for the ⁇  of the Sanin Main Line ( ⁇  Line) - Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture), and in 1997, it was moved and reconstructed in 1997 and reconstructed in 1997 and reconstructed as an entrance to the main building, and the interior was used as a library for the purpose of ⁇ ing old materials.
It was designated as a cultural property by Kyoto City in April 1996.
18 types of steam locomotives manufactured from the Taisho period to the Showa period (at the beginning of the opening of the station) were housed and exhibited in the Ogigata ⁇ .
At the beginning of the opening of the museum, there was a ⁇  of C53535 steam locomotives and a C51-type C23 steam locomotives, but after that, seven-car trains, which have been stored for the maintenance of storage, have been conducted several times since 2006, and seven-car trains have been preserved for preservation purposes.
Among them, the five types of train sets are now registered as a car, and two trains (C57 ⁇ , C56 ⁇  ⁇ ) are served on the main line, such as ' ⁇  (train)' on the Yamaguchi Line, ' ⁇  (train)' on the Hokuriku Main Line, and 'Kita- ⁇  (train).'
Because the registration equipments other than these two cars do not have sufficient inspections, it is impossible to run on the main line because no inspections are conducted in general.
Also, the 'SL team' train-cars, which are stored in the museum, are operated by the rails in the museum.
In the past, this display line was once running north from ⁇ -shako Depot to the north end of the premises of large parking lot (which once had a large-size parking lot in the premises), but it was changed to the current Umekoji-koen Park, which was moved to the former station house, and the current Umekoji-koen Park was moved to the south of the station building.
Even today, it has a function as an institution, and is connected with a commercial line.
Furthermore, after the Takatori factory of West Japan Railway Company was closed, steam locomotives were also improved.
Japanese▁plum
It originates from 'Ume' which means Umekoji.
All trains except C62 Type 62, which had been designated in 1976, have been designated as Type C62, and in 2006 it was designated as an ⁇ - ⁇  railway along with maintenance equipment for maintenance.
In 1972, the procedure to transfer from the former organization of the organization to the ⁇  was made in 1972.
Umekoji Station has no registered address since the preservation of Umekoji Station.

Shomyo is one of Japanese traditional music.
It is a religious music that is used for rites and festivals.
It is also called Bonbai or Bonnoku in Japan.
In the old ⁇ , it is written as  ⁇  in hiragana (Japanese syllabary characters).
It is one of the academic fields (gomyo or gomyo).
Gomyo refers to the five subjects of Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s), ⁇  ( ⁇ s of Letters, Monpo ( ⁇ s of Literature, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology), Myobodo (study of techniques), Inmyo (study of medicine), Naimyo ( ⁇ s of medicine), and Naimyo ( ⁇ s of Confucianism), and Buddhist scholars.
It was introduced into Japan along with Buddhism.
There is a record that a Buddhist memorial service was held in ⁇  when the Great Buddha of Todai-ji Temple was held, and it is thought that Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) was actively performed in the Nara period.
In the early Heian period, Saicho and Kukai transmitted Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) and the basis of Tendai Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) and Shingon Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant).
Even in Buddhist sects other than the Tendai sect and Shingon sect, each sect has their own Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) and has been handed down to the present day.
Since Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) passed down in oral teachings, there was no evidence to prove it.
Therefore, ⁇  was extremely difficult.
Later, hakase (master of astronomy) was invented by ⁇ , the equivalent of tenmon hakase (master of astronomy).
Also, depending on each school, the term " ⁇ " is used for specialized terms such as hakase.
However, hakase is a reference for chanting Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) and if they learn Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s), they are required to teach them, so they cannot maintain and inherit the school from their master to disciples.
Therefore, the development of leaders and successors was required.
With various conditions, many schools were abolished.
The Tendai Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) brought to Japan by Saicho was based on the basis and developed independently.
After Saicho, Ennin and Annen flourished.
It is known that ⁇ , the founder of ⁇ -ji Temple, was the Chuko no So (father of restoration).
In ⁇ , ⁇  built ⁇ -in Temple ( ⁇  Ward, Kyoto City) in Ohara, Kyoto.
The sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Gyozan of ⁇ -in Temple in Ohara, and is modeled after Mt. Gyozan in China.
Later, ⁇ -in Temple and Shoko-in Temple became known as the training hall for Shomyo Nenbutsu (Buddhist liturgical chant) of Ohara-ryu School.
Later, Jakugen formed a group, and in Ohara there were two lines of Shomyo Nenbutsu.
Later, ⁇  revived Ohara Shomyo (chanting of Ohara).
Tanchi developed the trend based on the new music theory.
Since then, it has been handed down as the center of Tendai Shomyo (chanting of Tendai Shomyo).
The Shomyo Nenbutsu sect, Jodo sect, Jodo Shinshu sect (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) and Jodo Shinshu sect (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) are the lineages of Tendai Shomyo.
Shingon Shomyo (chanting of Shingon Buddhism) was based on Kukai's ⁇ , and it is not known.
It was after the mid-Edo period that Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ ) was ⁇ .
Kancho can be said to have been the ⁇  of the restoration.
He strived to compose and improve Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ ).
There were many schools until the Kamakura period, but four schools (Honsoin-ryu, Shinsoin-ryu, Daigo-ryu, Daigo-ryu, and ⁇ -ryu) were established by Cloistered Imperial Prince Kakusho.
The Shomyo of the Kogi Shingon sect declined and disappeared during the Edo period.
It was abolished during the middle of the Meiji period, as the main school, the Shingiin school, the Daigo school, and the Daigo school.
Currently, it is divided into Chizan Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s), Buzan Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant), Nanto Hase-dera Temple, Mt. Nanzan, Mt. Koya, Mt. Koya, and the Kogi Shingon Sect in Kyoto.
The Shomyo Nenbutsu (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) of the Shingon sect Chizan school and the Shingon sect ⁇  school of Shingon Buddhism are derived from the Nakagawa school.
Raising Yoriudo to the Daigo school.
When Negoro-ji Temple ( ⁇  Prefecture) was burned down by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI in 1583, the Negoro-ji Temple in Mt. Chisan and Mt. Toyoyama fell into a group based on the old school of Daigo.
It is characterized as 'rongi' ( ⁇ ) of Mt. Toyoyama and 'shomyo' (chanting of Shomyo).
The Nakagawa Oshin school of the Nanzan Shingi Shingon sect (Kogi Shingon sect Shomyo) became the original school.
Nakagawa Oshin-ryu school was founded by Oishin at Nakagawa-dera Temple in Nara Prefecture.
During the Teiei era (1232 - ⁇ ), ⁇  of Mt. Koya and Sanbo-in Temple moved his base to Mt. Koya.
Later, he changed his name to Nanzan-ryu school, which was also called Mt. Koya.
He was the founder of the ⁇  school and the Noshin school.
The music of ⁇  such as Heikyoku, Yokyoku (Noh song), Joruri ( ⁇  narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment), Joruri ( ⁇  narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment), Joruri ( ⁇  narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment) and Joruri ( ⁇  narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment) can be said to have changed the meaning of Shomyo.
It is largely influenced by ⁇  music.

In addition, he was sentenced to death by ⁇ ing his political power, which caused a coup d' ⁇  in later years, such as the ⁇  Coup.
Because Baekje was destroyed by the Tang Dynasty and Silla Dynasty in ⁇ , he sent ⁇  FUYO, a son of the King of Paekche who stayed in the Imperial Court, and tried to revive Baekje.
He stayed in Tsukushi to lead Kudara (Paekche), but in 661, Empress Saimei passed away.
After that, the Imperial Throne did not ⁇  to the throne for a long time, but in 663, the capital was relocated to Otsu City and ascended the throne there.
After the Battle of Shiramura, he set up mizu-shiro (castles built on lakes or ⁇ es for defensive reasons) as a part of the policy of national defense against the land.

Brief Personal▁History
626 - Born.
The Crown Prince was formally installed on July 12, 445.
Saimei (August 24, 661) - Shosei system (a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code)
On February 20, ⁇ , Emperor Tenchi ascended the throne.
On January 7, 672, he died at the age of 46.
(There is a theory in " ⁇ " that says 'There is a theory that the Emperor died of illness, and he was killed in the mountains of Mt. Sanryo because he was killed by the Emperor Tenmu because he was killed in the mountain where he was killed by the Emperor's army.)
Emperor Tenchi did not succeed to the throne for a long time, and it is one of the ⁇ s in political history of the late seventh century.
There are several views on this matter.
The Emperor Tenmu intended to strengthen his power.
In other words, it is considered that the Emperor Tenmu was an established theory, but it is wrong that the Emperor Tenmu was the Emperor Tenchi's younger maternal half-brother before he married the Emperor Jomei, and that he was the Emperor Tenchi's older maternal half-brother.
In fact, if the year of Emperor Tenmu's death was calculated based on the age of Emperor Tenmu in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) and some history books, the year of Emperor Tenmu was the longest period.
However, there are many historical materials between the same historical materials, and there are many historical materials that describe the age of eight to nine.
On the other hand, there is a thesis in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) that 'if my father was a younger brother of the Emperor Tenchi,' but it is ⁇  that 'he was a younger brother of his older brother,' but the age of sixteen was passed away when Emperor Tenchi was sixteen years old when his father, Emperor Jomei, was enthroned, was enthroned.
Therefore, in 1414, the year of birth was adopted by the Honcho koin jounroku (the Emperor's family tree, made in the Muromachi period).
Against the "ancient times," there was a counterargument of the Emperor Tenchi and Emperor ⁇ , whose reign was not unusual in ancient times, and did not ascend to the throne immediately.
(In fact, there was a slight difference between them.)
There is also a theory that it is impossible to deal with the same reason because of the differences in history books that were compiled during the period of the 'Nihon Shoki' (Chronicles of Japan) and other history books which have been pointed out as 'Nihon Shoki' (Chronicles of Japan).
(Refer to the section on 'Emperor Tenmu's age')
There is a theory that Prince Karu was driven out of his position because he was a coup d' ⁇  by Karu no Miko (Emperor Kotoku).
Recently, it has been pointed out that the relationship between Naka no Oe no Oji and ⁇  no Oe no Oji was relatively good, and that the basic policy was similar to that of the Oe no Oji.
In this way, Naka no Oe no Oji ⁇  Iruka's murder.
In addition, the description in the Taika Reforms in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) allowed the modifications of the Taika Reforms, so this theory was advocated.
In addition, this theory attracts attention because the reason why Emperor Kogyoku abdicated the throne and the Soga clan other than Iruka was exiled even after the coup d' ⁇ .
There is a theory that the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi was caused by opposition to the female relationship of Emperor Tenchi.
This reflects the ⁇  relationship between the Emperor Kotoku and the Emperor Tenchi in the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) that the Emperor Kotoku put on his wife's daughter (Emperor Tenchi's cousin) in the poem.
Although the love and marriage of ⁇  and his sister were allowed to marry each other, the situation at that time was due to the ⁇  of the people in those days, and the ⁇  of ⁇  was interpreted in fact in the story of Ame no M ⁇  no ⁇  (Emperor Kotoku), who was persuaded by his uncle Karu no Okimi (Emperor Kotoku), and he was furiously furiously ⁇ ed the relationship of the relationship even after the assassination of his uncle Karu no Okimi.
After the death of Empress Saimei, there was a theory that ⁇  no Himemiko succeeded to the Imperial Throne as the consort of the previous emperor, but some records were ⁇  due to some reasons.
This is based on the theory that the person whose name was 'Naka no Mikoto' came from the theory that he was a princess of Emperor ⁇  in "Manyoshu" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves), and that 'Naka no Mikoto' could be interpreted as an emperor who succeeded to the Imperial Throne from Emperor Tenchi until the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi.
If ⁇  no Himemiko was called 'Naka no Mikoto', it can be said that she was given such a special title, but there is a theory that she was Empress Saimei, and there is no doubt that she was a princess of Emperor Saimei.
Due to the nature of political history and restrictions on historical materials, it is difficult to prove, but, as with the result of the results, the study of the future study has been progressing.
▁Poems
Four of his poems were selected in the Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).
In Ogura Hyakunin Isshu (the Ogura Anthology of One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Poets), KAKI ⁇  no Hitomaro as the founder of the Heian dynasty, and the following poems are included at the beginning of the poem.
In autumn field of autumn field, I'm ⁇ ing my sleeves, but I'm ⁇ ing my sleeves.
He was one of the following poems in Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).
Mt. Kaguyama is a place where the ⁇  and the ears of the ⁇  and the ⁇ s of the gods are ⁇ ed from ancient times.
The Saionji family was a court noble descended from the Fujiwara clan.
He was a member of the House of Fujiwara clan, and his social standing was the Seiga family (one of the highest court noble families in Japan at that time).
The ⁇  and Imadegawa families (Kikutei family) were branch families of the Saionji family.
In addition, the Saionji clan in Iyo Province was one of the most influential branch families of Saionji's family name.
His Kamon (family crest) was Sanmitsudomoe.
The Saionji family was founded by FUJIWARA no Michisue, the third son of FUJIWARA no ⁇ .
When Michisue's great-grandson, MINAMOTO no Michichika, was confined to the Imperial Court as a member of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) in the Jokyu War, he was suspected of being a relative of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo, and after the war he was trusted by the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), he gained the confidence of the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), seized real power of the Imperial Court as the head of the Imperial Family, and rose to the position of Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).
Saionji's family name was named after ⁇ -ji Temple, which was the second residence of Kintsune SAIONJI in Kyoto (Kitasoyama, Kadono County, Yamashiro Province).
This hall was also called Kitayama-dono Palace, and the current Kinkaku-ji Temple was built by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA from the Saionji family.
Starting with the support of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) since Kintsune, he had a strong influence on the Sekke (line of regents and advisers) through the Kamakura period.
 ⁇  SAIONJI married Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama), and made his daughter marry the Cloistered Emperor Kameyama and Emperor Godaigo.
However, after his son, Kinhira SAIONJI, the Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama) had distanced from the bakufu, the Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama) was opposed to the Jimyoin-to (imperial lineage from Emperor Gofukakusa to Emperor Gokomatsu) and deepened confrontation with the Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama).
Later, during the time of Kinmune SAIONJI, the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) fell and the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) was involved in the ⁇  Incident.
Kinmune harbored ⁇  HOJO (Tokioki HOJO), the remnants of the Hojo clan, and assassinated Emperor Godaigo, who started the Kenmu Restoration, and plotted to overthrow the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) after the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun); however, Kinmune was arrested and executed due to the betrayal of his younger brother, Kinshige SAIONJI.
During the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, ⁇  SAIONJI, the son of Kinmune, served the Northern Court (Japan) and became Udaijin (Minister of the Right), and restored the family name.
During the Muromachi period and the Edo period, the family specialized in biwa as their family business.
During the Muromachi period, ⁇  SAIONJI married Tadataka HOSOKAWA, the heir of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA (later disinherited) and Kyumu ⁇ , the first daughter of Kyumu ⁇ , to the position of ⁇  (Minister of the Sovereign's Household), but Kyumu ⁇  persuaded the Saionji family to become the Minister of the Left, and he gave 600 koku of funds to the Saionji family (according to " ⁇ koroku").
At the end of the Edo period, Kinmochi SAIONJI became an adopted son of Kinmochi SAIONJI, who was also a member of the Rikken ⁇ , and after the Meiji Restoration, he played an active role as a politician and played an active role in the politics of the Taisho and Showa periods as a Genro ( ⁇  statesman).
Incidentally, Kinmochi's performance of biwa (Japanese lute) in the Saionji family's family business was bitter, but during his term of prime minister, he was said to have been ⁇  by Emperor Meiji for his bad luck, 'I want to listen to biwa (Japanese lute) of the Saionji family from the Saionji family,' and it is said that he suffered four hardships from the staff of gagaku (ancient Japanese court dance and music) and biwa (Japanese lute) of the Imperial Household Ministry and the biwa (Japanese lute) of the Imperial Household Ministry.

According to the ⁇  written at the end of the book, the reason why the diary was written and the order of the Emperor was presented to his younger sister, FUJIWARA no Teishi, who was the second consort of the emperor, FUJIWARA no Teishi, and Emperor Ichijo, when he presented a copy of "Shiki" (history book), Sei Shonagon asked the Imperial Court about it, 'I am going to write " ⁇ " (history book).'
It is based on the fact that he was given a paper from the Imperial Palace (according to the San- ⁇ -bon line (three-volume book, 'Makura no Soshi Makura no Soshi' (The Pillow Book)) and ' ⁇  Makura no Soshi' (The Pillow Book) by Noinbon, and ' ⁇  Makura no Soshi' (The Pillow Book) by Noinbon, ' ⁇  Makura no Soshi' (The Pillow Book) and ' ⁇  Makura no soshi Makura no Soshi' (The Pillow Book).

 ⁇ -bon manuscript▁theory
There is no relationship between them.
However, there is no popular theory.
In addition, 'Makura no Soshi' (The Pillow Book) was used as a common noun in " ⁇ " (The Pillow Book) to express beautiful colors.
According to the same writing, the first draft was written around ⁇ , and MINAMOTO no Tsunefusa, who was a playwright, brought it out from the house of the author, to the world.
Even after that, he was never heard of, and it is thought that he wrote it around the end of the year of the Kanko era.
The text of "Makura no Soshi" (The Pillow Book), which was included in "Genji monogatari ⁇ sho" (The Tale of Genji's Commentary on the Tale of Genji), has not been extant in the text of "Makura no Soshi" (The Pillow Book) which is an old commentary on "Genji Monogatari ⁇ sho" (The Tale of Genji).

According to "Sei Shonagon Makura no Soshi" (The Pillow Book), she entered a box with gold and silver boxes, and she was called "Sei Shonagon" (The Pillow Book).
It is an Important Cultural Property.
It is considered to be the oldest among the manuscripts of "Makura no Soshi" (The Pillow Book), which were transcribed by FUJIWARA no Yukinari.
Among them, the Sakai-bon manuscript, after the Sakai-bon line, was divided into two volumes in " ⁇  ⁇ " (Collection of historical documents compiled by Hokiichi ⁇ ), and the Sakai-bon manuscript was included in "Shin ⁇  ⁇  ⁇ " (New Classified Documents).
Also, Noinbon was used as an original text for old type printing in the early Edo period, so it was used as a set of commentaries such as "Makura no Soshi ⁇ " (the Pillow Book) and "Makura no Soshi Shunsho" (the Pillow Book) (by Suemura ⁇ ).
However, in 1946, the second edition of the three-volume edition was re- ⁇  by Jutaro TANAKA (1917 - 1987), and after the World War II, it became a situation where the text was mainly published and used for textbooks.
On the other hand, "Makura no Soshi ⁇ " (The Pillow Book), a picture scroll depicting a white-colored drawing drawn in the late Kamakura period, is thought to have been used in the three-volume book, and "Makura no Soshi ⁇ " (The Pillow Book) which is thought to have been written in the late Kamakura period, still exists.
The second edition of the three-volume edition has an independent chapter of more than 300 chapters.
It consists of sections such as 'Ruijushodan' ( ⁇ s of the Past), 'Sumo no hana' (The flowers of the trees), 'Suzuremono' ( ⁇ s of the trees), 'Suzukakimono' ( ⁇ s of the trees), and 'Kuzushiki no dan' ( ⁇ s of the ⁇ s), and 'Zuishodan' ( ⁇ s of the Past) which depicts the nature of the four seasons, 'zuizuishodan' ( ⁇ s ⁇ s of the Imperial Household) and ' ⁇ shodan' ( ⁇ s ⁇ s of the Past), and 'Shoshodan' ( ⁇ s ⁇ s of the Presentation of the Past) which was written by Teishi, and 'Shodansho' ( ⁇  of the Consort's Household), and so on.
However, there is a commonly accepted theory that the way of classification is not clear (for example, the first chapter of 'Haru' is the first chapter of 'Haru no ⁇ ,' but in the latter part it is different from that of Zuisho Shodan).
It is written in the ⁇  style using Manyo-gana (a form of syllabary used in the Manyoshu [Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves]), and many of them are written in simple style, but reflecting the ⁇  of the decline of the Nakanokanpaku family and the death of his master Teishi/Sadako, which reflects the ⁇  of the ⁇  of his master and empress, it is also exposed to the ⁇  of his wounds at that time.
With the sophisticated ⁇  of the author's work and sharp observations, he ⁇ ed the ' ⁇ ' beauty of the "Genji Monogatari" (The Tale of Genji) into the ' ⁇ ' beauty of the ' ⁇ ' world.
 ⁇ ▁evaluation
Because "Makura no Soshi" (The Pillow Book) was deeply loved by human beings and nature, it was created as a beauty of polysaccharide in each rank and formed (by Sakusaku ⁇ ).
In the next chapter of each chapter, there is no distinction between ⁇ s, ⁇ s, ⁇ s, and ⁇ s, and the material is ⁇  by the expression of the weathering of the sky by the expression of ' ⁇ ' (Kogigaya).
The expression of ' ⁇  - ⁇ ' ( ⁇  in spring, etc.) is a work of the Ministry of Central Affairs (Fujimoto) which was a ⁇  war between the readers of the readers who were familiar with waka (Japanese traditional poem of thirty-one syllables) as seen in ' ⁇  - Flowering Fortune' which was seen in Manyo-gana (a form of syllabary used in the Manyoshu [Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves]) at that time, followed by ' ⁇  - Asa' (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) and ' ⁇  - Asa' ( ⁇  Leaves).
It was the ⁇  of Teishi's ⁇  to Chugu Teishi.
It was written in order to calm the soul of Teishi, who died while Michitaka's family fell into decline.
Therefore, it is natural that Michitaka's family declined (this is the same).
Even in the era when people who took care of chugu (the second consort of an emperor) and chugu (the second consort of an emperor) were disappointed, they insisted that they lived in the world of love and good fortune ( ⁇ ).
Evaluation▁evaluation
It appears in a ⁇  way that he tried to ⁇  Sei Shonagon's class and tried to ⁇  him into the upper class (according to another theory, he was exiled to Mt. Akiyama).
(There is no ⁇  for those who are not allowed to be a relative of his or her family, nor those who have a high social status.)
There is a description in ' ⁇  of Civilization in the inner palace of Teishi (Sadako ISHIDA)' that is not written based on the qualification of ' ⁇ .'
Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA was the 15th Seii Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) (his reign was from December 5, 1866 to December 9, 1867).
He was the only shogun who didn't carry out his duty as Shogun in Edo-jo Castle.
He was Naidaijin (Minister of the Center) and Juichii (Junior First Rank) the First Order of Merit.
He was a member of Kizokuin (the House of Peers).
After the death of the 14th Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA, who acted as a guardian of Shogun's guardian, he assumed the post of the 15th Shogun of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
After the Emperor Meiji returned political power (= Taisei Hokan [transfer of power back to the Emperor]), he aimed at kobu- ⁇  ( ⁇  of the imperial court and the shogunate government]), but in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi after the Restoration of Imperial Rule, he was ordered to return to Edo-jo Castle from Edo-jo Castle and ordered the Imperial Court to hunt down and kill Edo-jo Castle and surrender Edo-jo Castle.
When he was suspended from home during the Meiji period, he devoted himself to his ⁇  and lived until the Taisho period as a prince.
Yoshinobu' is also read as 'Yoshinonobu' or 'Keiki' as his common name.
There is a record in the official documents of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) as "Yoshihisa."
Her name is also written as ' ⁇ ' in English and in English- ⁇  newspaper.
Although he is often called 'Yoshinobu' in Mito City where he was born, he is often referred to as 'Keiki' in Shizuoka City where he spent his remaining years.
According to a person who knows Yoshinobu while he was alive, Yoshinobu himself was fond of 'Keiki-sama' and he called himself 'Keiki' to his younger brother Akitabu TOKUGAWA.
It is said that Yoshinobu's successor, ⁇  TOKUGAWA, was also called 'Keikyu-sama' by people around the same time as Yoshinobu.
Although the two names of 'Keiki-sama' and 'Keiki-san' can be confirmed in modern times, the term 'Keiki-san' is rarely used in many places in Shizuoka Prefecture, and even in Shizuoka Prefecture, the term 'Keiki-san' is often used.
There is a description that 'there are many people related to the ⁇  family,' but there is a possibility that the use of the people of the Higo Domain, who were engaged in overthrowing the Shogunate, might have been ⁇  or ⁇  in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, because the use of the word "Keiki" was confirmed by people involved in overthrowing the Shogunate.
On October 29, ⁇ , he was born as the seventh son of ⁇  KUKI, the ninth lord of the Mito Domain in Edo.
His mother was the legal wife of Princess Yoshiko (Yoshiko, the third Shogun, Iemitsu TOKUGAWA's lawful wife) and the real mother of Iemitsu TOKUGAWA.
However, Iemitsu's real mother is said to be Oe no kata, the legal wife of her father Hidetada, but some say that Kasuga no Tsubone was the real mother of Kasuga no Tsubone.
His childhood name was ⁇ maro.
According to the educational policy of Nariaki TOKUGAWA, 'He was raised by the nation,' he moved to Mito Domain seven months after his birth, and many of his students were taught and taught martial arts and martial arts from Seisai EIZAWA and others.
He seemed to have been ⁇  by Yoshinobu at that time, and at first, Nariaki did not have an adopted child to another family, so he thought that he would remain in the care of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA, his eldest son (the eldest son) and ⁇  TOKUGAWA.
On September 1, ⁇ , ⁇ maro was ordered by the bakufu to inherit ⁇ maro from Mito Domain to Mito Domain.
In response to this, ⁇ maro returned to the Hitotsubashi family on September 1, and in December, he was granted a portion of the real name of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA from the 12th Shogun Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA.
Ieyoshi often visited the Hitotsubashi residence and suggested Yoshinobu as a candidate for heir to the Shogun, but he gave up receiving advice from roju (member of shogun's council of elders) Masahiro ABE.
In 1853, during the confusion in the ⁇  of the Black Ships, Ieyoshi died of illness, and Iesada TOKUGAWA, the 13th Shogun, who succeeded Ieyoshi, was sickly and a son of the 13th Shogun Iesada TOKUGAWA, who had succeeded to the position of Shogun, became apparent (the issue of Shogun's successor).
The Hitotsubashi group consisting of Nariaki TOKUGAWA and Masahiro ABE, the lord of the Satsuma domain, Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA, and Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA, the lord of the Kishu Domain, and the ⁇  group of the O-oku group which supported Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA, the real mother of Iesada and the real mother of Iesada.
The Hitotsubashi group tried to put Tenshoin, the adopted daughter of Nariakira SHIMAZU, into O-oku (the inner halls of Edo Castle where the wife of the Shogun and her servants reside) as the Shogun's wife and the Shogun's wife, but after Masahiro ABE and Nariakira SHIMAZU died one after another, the Tairo (chief minister) Naosuke II, who became Tairo (chief minister) died one after another, made a decision to ' ⁇  the heir of Shogun Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA.'
In the same year, Naosuke II signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan without imperial sanction.
Yoshinobu, together with Nariaki, the lord of Fukui Domain, ⁇  MATSUDAIRA, and others, ⁇ ed Nariaki TOKUGAWA, but in the following year, 1859, he was ordered to retire and be confined to his house (the Ansei ⁇ ).
When Yoshinobu himself did not want to become heir to the Shogun, he sent a letter to Nariaki saying 'I don't want to do it, but I have to do so since I'm failure to take the reins of the government.'
In 1860, he was suspended from office.
In 1862, Imperial envoy ⁇  ⁇ , a guard of Satsuma Domain led by Hisamitsu SHIMAZU, went to Edo and ordered Emperor Komei to appoint Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA as Shogun's guardian and appoint him as Tairo (chief minister).
On July 6, the Edo bakufu appointed Yoshinobu as the guardian of the shogun, and ⁇  as the president of political affairs.
Yoshinobu and ⁇  implemented the reformation of the shogunate government called Bunkyu Reform, and established Kyoto ⁇  (Military governor of Kyoto) and ⁇  (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo) and ⁇  (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo).
In 1863, he went up to Kyoto as an attendant to Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA, and made an effort to negotiate with the Imperial Court against the expulsion of foreigners.
When Emperor Komei visited Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine to pray for the expulsion of foreigners by prayer for the expulsion of foreigners, the emperor ordered Iemochi to carry out the expulsion of foreigners, saying that he would carry out the expulsion of foreigners, and he ordered Iemochi to have an audience with him.
When the Sonno Joi ha (supporters of the doctrine of restoring the emperor and expelling the barbarians) led by the Choshu clan broke out in the Coup of August 18 (old calendar), he went to Kyoto again to participate in the Sanyo-kaigi (a council of state) with the support of Kobu Gattai ( ⁇  between the imperial court and the shogunate) and the Shogunate.
However, it can be said that the conference was ⁇ , and he made a plan to stop the government by saying that he was ⁇  in the drinking party with Imperial Prince Kuninomiya ⁇  and others, ⁇ ing ⁇ -jo Castle, ⁇ -jo Castle, ⁇ -jo Castle, ⁇ -jo Castle, and ⁇ -jo Castle, and furthermore, he ⁇  NAKAGAWA's intention, saying 'I'm going to the Shimazu family,' and furthermore, he tried to ⁇  the system.
After that, he was appointed as Kinri Goshuei Sotoku (Governor-General of the Imperial Palace Guard) by the Imperial Court in Kyoto, and he was in charge of loyal supporters of the Emperor and court nobles along with ⁇  MATSUDAIRA (the lord of Aizu Domain) and ⁇  MATSUDAIRA (the lord of Aizu Domain) and Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA (the lord of Kuwana Domain) (the lord of Kuwana Domain).
During the Tenguto no Ran ( ⁇  of Tenguto), he showed his coolness to cut down the vassals of his parents and Mito Domain, including ⁇ sai TAKEDA, who supported Yoshinobu.
In 1864, the Choshu army was attacked by the bakufu army in the Kinmon Incident, and attacked the Choshu army which occupied Takatsukasa's residence.
Following this, he was involved in the conquest of Choshu, and engaged in the Imperial sanction for the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan, and succeeded in obtaining imperial sanction on the condition that the Imperial sanction for the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan was prohibited.
In the second conquest of Choshu in 1866, Yoshinobu received an imperial order to attack Choshu by suppressing the Satsuma Domain's ⁇ .
However, the bakufu's army was defeated due to the rejection of the Satsuma clan's dispatch of troops to Satsuma.
On August 20, during the second Choshu Conquest, Shogun Iemochi died in Osaka-jo Castle.
Yoshinobu took the Imperial Court's movement to ⁇  the imperial rescript and concluded a peace agreement.
Although Iemochi was recommended to succeed Iemochi, Yoshinobu refused this proposal.
On August 20, the Tokugawa Shogun family inherited the position of Shogun, but he refused to assume the position of Shogun.
After that, roju (member of shogun's council of elders) and other members of Roju (member of shogun's council of elders) agreed to the Emperor, but they did not accept it, and on December 5, he was recommended by the Emperor (from the Emperor Komei) and assumed the position of shogun.
This was because he was forced to become a shogun by selling favors, and there was a rumor that he would take advantage of politics.
Yoshinobu was supported by the French minister Leon Léon ROCHEROE, and established the Japan-Ming trade office, the construction of the ⁇  Shipyard and the Shusen Ships, and implemented military reforms involving military advisors such as Jurée Brene.
Also, he encouraged his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA to study in Europe, such as sending his younger brother Akitaka TOKUGAWA to Paris.
At the issue of the opening of Hyogo port, the Imperial Court was given permission by the Emperor to ⁇ e the Imperial Court.
Yoshinobu, who was ⁇  to 'the secret imperial command to attack the shogunate' to the Satsuma and Choshu clans, reported to the Imperial Court on October 14, 1867 (the Taisei Hokan [transfer of power back to the Emperor]).
It is said that the Imperial Court at that time did not have an administrative capacity, and it was said that the Tokugawa government was trying to maintain the Tokugawa regime by leading the council of feudal lords.
However, Toshimichi OKUBO and Tomomi IWAKURA, who aimed to overthrow the Shogunate, issued an order in December, and in December, Yoshinobu was ordered to 'Jikan nochi' (resignation of resignation of Naidaijin and ⁇  of Tokugawa's territory).
Yoshinobu left Osaka-jo Castle in order to avoid conflict, provoked the ministers of foreign countries and insisted on the Tokugawa conquest and the Imperial Court, and also requested the Imperial Court to change the Jikan nochi (an application for resignation) into a ⁇  form.
However, in the following year, 1868, the Satsuma Domain raised an army in response to the ⁇  of the Satsuma Domain that had been carried out in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, and dispatched soldiers of Aizu and Kuwana Domain to Kyoto.
However, despite the fact that the former Shogunate forces were ⁇  in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi which broke out on January 3 (January 3 under the old lunar calendar) and the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, they left their military force and retreated to Edo in "Kaiyo Maru" (Kaiyo Maru Warship).
Soon after, the order to track down and kill Yoshinobu as an enemy of the Imperial Court was issued, and the Imperial army, which was led by Dai Sotoku (Governor-General of the Dazai-fu [local government office in Kyushu region]), led by Dai Sotoku-fu (Commander-in-Chief of the Great Governor-General of the Dazai-fu [local government office in Kyushu region]), started the east campaign.
Yoshinobu insisted on ⁇ ing his allegiance by suppressing the resistance force led by ⁇  ⁇ .
In February, he entrusted Kaishu KATSU to take part in the situation and was suspended at Daijiin of Ueno Kanei-ji Temple.
Also, the head of the Tokugawa family, Kamenosuke TAYASU (later Tatsunosuke TOKUGAWA) was adopted as his adopted son.
When the negotiations with the government staff officer Takamori SAIGO and the staff officer of the government army were ⁇ ed, Yoshinobu's treatment of the Edo-jo Castle was transferred to Mito, and he stayed in the room of the ⁇  (domain school) Hiromichi ⁇ .
In July, he moved to Sunpu where the Tokugawa family was transferred.

After that, he did not take part in politics, and devoted himself to his ⁇ , such as photographing, hunting, ⁇ , Igo (board game of capturing territory), and yokyoku (Noh song).
In 1897, he moved to Sugamo, Tokyo.
In the following year, he visited the Imperial Palace and had an audience with Emperor Meiji.

On the same day, he was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun with ⁇  Flower.
Regarding the learning of military arts and learning, he grew up in the highest environment and was enthusiastic about the art of ⁇  from various martial arts, and was a master of ⁇ .
Even after the Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor), he was the most famous person among the masters of ⁇ -jutsu (art of warfare) and taught them to every day.
He did not sleep well, and when his father, Ienari, was sleeping in bed as a problem in the succession of the Tokugawa family, he tried to put a sword on his bedside (it is said that he was a mere threat and he was ⁇  when he was sleeping).
On the other hand, there is an anecdote that when he came to sleep after his coming of age, he met his wife and two mistresses with the letter 'Y' (YYY) for the purpose of assassination.
Yoshinobu is said to be a photographer of Yoshinobu, but it is not considered that he was a photographer in Japan at the time of Yoshinobu's youth, so it is not clear whether Yoshinobu himself was himself.
It is said that he visited Iemochi's visit to see Iemochi, who fell ill, and at that time, he was ⁇  to visit him.
He was known for his ⁇ , and ⁇  AJIMA, his biological father-in-law, described Yoshinobu as 'Kiyotada TOKUGAWA, who was ⁇  to the Tokugawa family,' and he assumed the position of shogun with the hope of restoring dignity of the Tokugawa clan, and he praised his reputation as ' ⁇  Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.'
Hideaki, who was on the side of the overthrow of the Shogunate, also went to the group of the anti-shogunate group, and especially Takayoshi KIDO of the Choshu Domain said, 'It is impossible to ⁇  Yoshinobu ⁇ 's ⁇ .
He seemed to have been watching Ieyasu again.'
In response to Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor), Ryoma SAKAMOTO said, 'Okiko (Shogun's son), and today's suicide is ⁇ .
Even if you are to be ⁇ , you will be ⁇  to you even if you are ⁇ .
In the end, he gave an evaluation of his life for the public and tried to give Yoshinobu the position of vice chief adviser to the new government.
However, it was in the Meiji period when Yoshinobu knew that Ryoma was Ryoma's presence (after Ryoma's death).
There are no stories about Yoshinobu, and it is very interesting that Ryoma died while he was alive after the Meiji Restoration.
When he was defeated in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, he ran away to Edo and was criticized by his enemy, saying, 'The enemy's flight'.
At this time, although the seal of Kinogi ( ⁇  fans) had been handed down since the time of Ieyasu, there were some who did not forget the ⁇  of Yoshinobu, and they were ⁇  of the ⁇  of Yoshinobu's ⁇ .
However, there is also an opinion that this was because they needed to resist armed uprisings in Edo and Musashi Provinces, and because Yoshinobu became the Emperor's enemy, they ⁇  from Osaka-jo Castle, and the long-term battle was necessary to prevent the intervention of foreign countries.
It is said that he was highly regarded as an enemy of the new government because he was confined to Kanei-ji Temple or confined to Kanei-ji Temple (Mitogaku, Mitogaku, or Mitogaku, a thought of reverence for the Emperor and the Imperial Court), but on the other hand, he did not show his respect to his lord, because he was ⁇  by his enemies as a lord.
Due to the fact that he was forced to transfer the government to the government while he was in a state close to the bloodless revolution, he was highly evaluated for his achievement in the Restoration.
He was a retainer of the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family when he was the head of the Hitotsubashi-Tokugawa family, and he was promoted even after the Meiji Restoration.
In the last years of Yoshinobu's life, ⁇  wrote ' ⁇  Dream-e' to ⁇  Yoshinobu's biography, in which he heard about Yoshinobu's ⁇ .
" ⁇ mue no ⁇ " is a collection of these books.
According to the chapter in the form of a part-time meeting, it can be seen that the voice of Yoshinobu in the wedding ceremony can be seen.
It can be said that his character and heart of the time can be seen in the fact that he was a person who did not like him when he was still a child, and he was ⁇  by the words, 'I don't like ⁇ ,' 'I don't like you,' and 'I am a ⁇  person.'
Based on these materials, " ⁇  Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA Koki" was completed after Yoshinobu's death.
In order to show gratitude to the Emperor Meiji, who was given the highest rank of the peerage as an enemy of the Imperial Court, Yoshinobu left his will in accordance with his funeral ceremony instead of a Buddhist ceremony.
For this reason, the grave of Yoshinobu was not in the graveyard of the Tokugawa family in Kanei-ji Temple, which was the family temple of the Tokugawa family, but a similar round ⁇  was built in Taninaka Reien.
This was due to the ⁇  of the imperial mausoleum of Emperor Komei (according to "Koyo ⁇  Koki" (Diary of Yoshinobu ⁇ )).
After the pardon, Katsukiyo ⁇ , roju (member of shogun's council of elders) at that time, expressed his regret that Yoshinobu had no choice but to devote himself to his life without worrying about his life.
There was a negative image in ' ⁇ mae' ( ⁇  of the enemy) in the Battle of Nagashino, but after Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor), it has been re- ⁇  in recent years, and there is a movement to revaluate Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA (NHK Historical Drama) by introducing new views.
Like his father Nariaki, he liked pork in Satsuma Domain, and was called ⁇  Ichisama ( ⁇ -sama, pork and pork were fond of ⁇ -sama).
In his later years, he was interested in Western literary works, and he seemed to be interested in painting, fishing, microorganisms, microorganisms, ⁇ s, and tegeis ( ⁇ s), but it seems that he learned ⁇  from ⁇  NISHI (illuminator) during the time of Shogun.
He is famous as a ⁇ man, but it seems that he didn't follow the technique of shooting.
It is said that he often contributed to the magazine, but he was not able to use it.
His great-grandson, ⁇  TOKUGAWA, was also a freeman, and his photograph taken by Yoshinobu was found in the house of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA, including the photograph taken by Yoshinobu.
His younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA was a friend of his ⁇ .
On December 3, 1855, he changed his name to ⁇  ICHIJO (he changed his name to Yoshiko MIGA after the Meiji Restoration).
He and Biga were born on July 16, 1858, but died young on July 20, 1858.
Since then, he had no children with ⁇ , and in the Meiji period, his tenth son, 11 daughters, who were born between two concubines, were all born.
The couple included the seventh son, Ieyoshi, who succeeded to the Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA family, the tenth son, and the tenth son, ⁇ , who became the adopted son-in-law of Kaishu KATSU, and the ninth daughter, Tsuneko, who became the wife of Fushiminomiya Hiroyasu.

▁Note
Nara Line is a railway ( ⁇  line) of West Japan Railway Company (JR West) that connects Kizu Station (Kyoto Prefecture) in Kizugawa City, Kyoto Prefecture and Kyoto Station on the Kyoto Line of the West Japan Railway Company (JR West).
The entire line is included in the metropolitan area of the metropolitan area.
Because it's a terminal station on the Kansai Main Line, its official starting point is Kizu Station, but the trains running from Kyoto to Kizu Station arrive at and depart from Kyoto Station (the number of train numbers is odd), and the inbound train makes up the inbound train (the number of trains is odd).
Except for the detailed data, it will be described in the direction of Kizu from Kyoto to Kizu.
Its selection is green tea, and the reason why the selection is said to be 'a ⁇  image of the old capital connecting two ancient capitals.'
The jurisdiction ( ⁇  type): West Japan Railway Company ( ⁇  operator)
Route distance (operation kilometers): 34.7▁km
Track gauge: ⁇ ▁mm
Number of stations: 19 (including the starting and terminal stations)
 ⁇ -track section: Shinden - Uji section, JR ⁇  - Kyoto▁section
 ⁇ ed section: entire line (DC 1500V)
 ⁇  ( ⁇ ) system: A ⁇  block system (track section) and a single track automatic block system (track section)
 ⁇  device: A ⁇  Train Stop▁system
Operation center: Shin-Osaka General Control▁Center
M ⁇  speed: ⁇  km/h, ⁇  km/h (track section)
Except for Kizu Station, this station is under the jurisdiction of the Kyoto branch of the West Japan Railway Company (Kizu Station is managed by the Osaka Branch Office of West Japan Railway Company).
As the name of the line, the line between Kyoto and Kizu is named Nara Line, but the entire line is located in Kyoto Prefecture, and there is no route in Nara Prefecture.
This was due to the process of separating the section from Kizu to Nagoya as a part of the Osaka - Nagoya route after the Kansai Railway was merged into Kansai Railway Company, but the route was separated from Kizu to Nagoya as a part of the Kansai Railway Company.
However, trains run from Kizu Station to Nara Station on the Kansai Main Line (Yamatoji Line) and arrive at Nara Station in Nara Prefecture.
JR West established the nickname of the line (JR Kyoto Line, JR Kobe Line and so on) in accordance with the revision of March 13, 1988, but the Nara Line was ⁇ .
Since Kintetsu Nara Line is located in Kintetsu Nara Line, it is sometimes referred to as 'JR Nara Line.'
During the era of Japan National Railways ( ⁇ ), it was called ' ⁇  Nara Line of Japan National Railways' and the English letter 'JNR' was also added to the announcement board.
Kintetsu Nara Line is in rivalry with the Yamatoji Line between Nanba Station and Nara Station, and the Kintetsu Nara Line is on the Kintetsu Kyoto Line, which is on the opposite side of JR Nara Line.
While many trains on the Keihan Keishin Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line had been operated in parallel before the electrification of the Nara Line until 1984 at the end of the JNR era, trains on the Nara Line weren't electrified, and even after the electrification of the JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series ⁇ , two cars of the JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series 105 were used for a while.
However, after JR West was established, the operation of this type of train was accelerated due to the increase in the number of rapid trains, such as the four-car trains (some of them were six-car trains) in the Urban Network, and the double-track section became a double-track section, and the section became a double-track section and the section became a double-track section became a double-track section, and the operation of rapid trains such as the ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' ( ⁇ ji Rapid Service) and so on.
Today, the characteristics of commuters and ⁇ s from the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture such as Uji City Byodo-in Temple in Uji City, and Kumiyama-cho, Uji City, Kyoto Prefecture, have become stronger.
However, it is largely divided into the east side of Momoyama Station and Shinden Station, and in the south of Joyo City, the Kintetsu Kyoto Line, which runs in the south of Joyo City, runs in parallel with the urban area of Joyo City, is still in use.
Although the cars of the Osaka Municipal Transportation Bureau are used, the station facilities are managed by the Kyoto Branch, except for Kizu Station, except for Kizu Station.
J- ⁇  cards, Suica of East Japan Railway Company (JR East), ⁇  of Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) and PiTaPa of KANSAI  ⁇  ⁇  can be used at all stations.
In the south of Joyo Station, a simple ticket gate is provided for convenience.
Since the 'Kuroshio (train)' connected to the Nara Line, Sakurai Line and Wakayama Line was discontinued in 1984, local trains had been operated until 1991 (as a limited express train was temporarily operated for a certain period of time), but currently four types of rapid trains, rapid trains, local trains and local trains, local trains, local trains, local trains, and local trains are operated.
This is the highest type of train operated on the Nara Line, and it is operated mainly in the daytime.
Basically, local trains and local trains make connections with local trains and local trains at 30 minutes.
The nickname ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' was chosen by the general public before the timetable was revised.
As a sightseeing train connecting Kyoto and Nara, it is often used by foreigners not only by Japanese but also by foreigners.
The rolling stock of the JR (West) ⁇  Train Series 221 is operated by four-car trains or six-car trains.
The maximum speed is ⁇  km/h on the Sanyo Shinkansen line at ⁇  km/h, while the maximum speed is ⁇  km/h on the Sanyo Shinkansen line.
The standard time is approximately 44 minutes from Kyoto Station to Nara Station, and approximately 47 minutes from Nara Station.
The trains bound for Kyoto stop at Kamikoma Station or Tanakura Station on the way to Kyoto and arrive at the Miyakoji Rapid Service on the Nara route, which is different from the Miyakoji Rapid Service on the Nara route, so there are slightly differences between the inbound and outbound trains and outbound trains.
During the first three days of the New Year's holiday season, a special express train stopped at Inari Station for the purpose of visiting ⁇ -taisha Shrine.
▁History
March 3, 2001: The operation started.
March 15, 2003: With the timetable revision, trains began to stop at Tofuku-ji Station and Tamamizu Station.
It is operated during the rush hour during the rush hour.
This stop also stops at JR Ogura Station and Shinden Station (Kyoto Prefecture) where the ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' runs.
The rolling stock used on the Nara Electric Railway Series ⁇  was operated by four-car trains or six-car trains.
Basically, local trains and local trains make connections with local trains and local trains at 30 minutes.
Like the Miyakoji Rapid Service mentioned above, there is a stop at Narayama Station where rapid trains on the Yamatoji Line stop.
Until March 2001, ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' was introduced, and JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series ⁇  was used in Kyoto, Uji, Joyo ( ⁇  at first) and Nara, and JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series 113 was used for the operation of the ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' trains; however, after that, JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series ⁇  wasn't used in the Nara Line.
There is a train that directly connects to the Yamatoji Line in order to operate trains on the Osaka Loop Line.
It is operated mainly in the morning and at night.
It was originally operated only on weekdays but it was also operated on ⁇  and holidays from March 18, 2006 to March 18,▁2006.
Although the trains between Uji Station and Uji Station used to run on the Uji Line at the end of the night, there used to be a plan to drive local trains on the Kizu-gawa River at the same time, but currently the local trains running on the Uji Line were changed to the terminal station.
One of the trains that start from Kyoto Station on ⁇  and holidays are operated with the JR (West) ⁇  Train Series ⁇  and all of them are operated with the ⁇  Train Series ⁇ .
There is a direct train from the Yamatoji Line to the Yamatoji Line in order to operate trains on the Osaka Loop Line.
Rapid trains on the Nara Line used the same color as ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' or ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' to prevent confusion with the Yamatoji Line, but due to the change in the timetable revision of March 2008, the timetable revision made in the morning and evening became ⁇  with green letters and the express trains on the Nara Line ceased to be used.
It is described in Shijimon ( ⁇  characters) on the front of Kamikoma Station.
It is operated between Kyoto Station, Uji Station, Joyo Station and Kameoka Station.
During the daytime, the route between Kyoto Station and Joyo Station was operated every 15 minutes, but the section between Joyo Station and Kizu Station became 30 minutes.
Basically, trains run on the 103 series and run on the 103 series, but some of them are operated by the ⁇  series.
Some trains run directly to the Yamatoji Line in the early morning and late at night during the morning and late night.
In the past, the Nara Line and Sakurai Line were divided in the operation of the Sakurai Line, but in September 1994, the Nara Line and the Sakurai Line were divided.
Although it is unmanned, it is sometimes operated in the Nara Line as well.
From 1987 to 1988, the nickname 'Kuroshio' (train) and 'Kuroshio (train)' (train) ran between Kyoto Station and Shirahama Station on the Kansai Main Line, using the nickname 'Kuroshio Train Series 381,' which ran between Kyoto Station and Hakuhama Station.
On January 6, 1998, in the Kinki edition of the Kyoto- ⁇  edition, there was a report that the operation of the limited express trains on the Nara Line was announced in 2001 (as a regular train on the Nara Line), but the plan was later cancelled.
There was a time when the Miyakoji Rapid Service was operated between Kyoto Station and Sakurai Station (between Kyoto Station and Nara Station, Rapid Service trains stopped at Miyakoji Station), but currently no special train service to the Sakurai Line including the special rapid train has been made.
During mid-August, the Uji-gawa River ⁇  Festival, which is the nearest destination to the Uji-gawa River, is operated every special schedule until the end of the 16th timetable, because the transportation capacity cannot be secured, all of the local trains have been operated only for 10 minutes since the 16th century, and after the 16th century, all trains are operated in the section between Kyoto Station and Uji Station.
Some local trains arrive at and depart from Kizu Station.
The timetable of March 3 at that time was a special schedule for a single single track, and Rapid trains were operated between Kyoto Station and Uji Station, as well as the frequency of operation between Uji Station and Uji Station.
Sometime, some trains began making stops at Momoyama Station.
Around 1992, Rapid trains on the Sakurai Line were operated for one hour between Tenri Station and Tenri Station, mainly on ⁇  and holidays.
In addition, the trains that are exclusively operated exclusively for groups throughout Japan are sometimes sometimes operated.
In particular, when the Tenrikyo ⁇ tai on October 26 every year, trains called ' ⁇  Train Series ⁇  Train' are operated directly from Kyoto Station to Kizu Station on the Nara Line, Kizu Station, Yamatoji Line, Nara Station, Nara Station and Sakurai Line.
All of them belong to Nara Train Depot.
JR (West) ⁇  Train Series<unk>
There are two types of cars, four cars and six-car trains on the Yamatoji Line and the Osaka Loop Line.
It is mainly used for ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' and ' ⁇  Rapid Service' or ' ⁇  Rapid Service,' but in the Nara period four-car trains are mainly used for the Nara Line.
Two-car trains and two-car trains can be seen on holidays.
JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series▁103
Rapid trains of the 103 series used for local trains on the Nara Line are operated not only on the Nara Line but on the Nara Line, but also on the Osaka Loop Line and the Yamatoji Line during the rush hour.

Keiji Bypass (Keiji Bypass, Anglo-PSSSSSSSSS) is a general Bypass that runs from Kusatsu City, Shiga Prefecture to Kumiyama Town, Kuse County, Kyoto Prefecture.
It is designated as a plan for local high- ⁇  highways.
The Keiji Bypass, which is operated by the Keiji Bypass, is explained below, and the Keiji Bypass of the Keiji Bypass of the National Highway Route No. 1 and 24 will be explained below.
It is connected with Meishin Expressway, and connects with Meishin Expressway and Kyoto City Bus, and connects to ⁇  Interchange of Meishin Expressway, Nagoya City, and ⁇  Interchange and Osaka City.
Based on the law, the Seta Higashi Interchange and the Kumiyama- ⁇  Interchange are based on National Route 1 and 478, while the Kumiyama- ⁇  Interchange (Keiji Bypass) and the Kumiyama- ⁇  Interchange are National Highway Route No. 478, based on National Highway Route No. 478, and Kumiyama- ⁇  Interchange (Kyoto ⁇  Expressway), and the Kumiyama-cho Interchange is a high- ⁇  highway (National Highway ⁇  Expressway) which is designated by the National Highway Route No. ⁇ , and the Kumiyama-toge Mountain ⁇  is a national highway (National Highway ⁇  Expressway) and the Kumiyama-toge Pass.
In the later plan, the construction of roads with the ⁇  of Meishin Expressway and the construction of the Kyoto L ⁇  Expressway, connecting Kyoto Tanba Road and Keiji Bypass, which were the National Highway Route No. 9, and Kyoto Outer R ⁇  Expressway, was created.
The construction of the Daini-Keihan-Keihan-Doro Bypass and Kyoto- ⁇  Digic Road has been continuously promoted to National Highway Route No. ⁇ , and the maintenance of the road has continued.
According to the indication of the route, it is said to be a Keiji Bypass at the east end of Seta Higashi-Maizuru Station and the section between Oyamazaki Station and Oyamazaki Station.
Also, there is no difference between the Meishin Expressway and the Keiji Bypass via either routes or the ETC discount system.
If no special mention is made, Keiji Bypass (from Setahigashi Interchange to Oyamazaki Station) is used as the name of a business operator.

As for the background of IC numbering, the section indicating the ⁇  of the IC card indicates the road maintenance section.
In addition, the background of the facility's name column indicates that the facilities do not have facilities.

(The section under the jurisdiction of the Ibaraki Office is the section between Meishin Expressway Kyoto Higashi Interchange and ⁇  Station, the Dainikeihan Road and the Kyoto  ⁇  Expressway.)
August 29, 1988: The Seta Higashi IC/ ⁇ - ⁇  section was opened to traffic.
March 30, 2003: The huge ⁇  IC - Kumiyama-cho section was opened.
As a result, the fare system was unified with the other Japan Road Public Corporation Public Corporation (currently Neck ⁇ ) system.
August 10, 2003: The entire Kumiyama-cho section was opened to traffic by the opening of the Oyamazaki- ⁇  Station.
December 24, 2003: The Oyamazaki Interchange opened.

The Uji Tunnel of this line, which has a long National Route 113 and 313 meters long, is prohibited except for the buses of Uji Higashi IC and Kasatori Interchange, except for 500 meters in front of the Kasatori Interchange.
Prior to the opening of the Kumiyama ⁇ , the film "THEVE IIDE II Bridge  ⁇ " was shot in the movie before the opening.
The distance from the Setahigashi Interchange to the Oyamazaki Interchange is shorter than that of the Meishin Expressway, and when the Keiji Bypass runs parallel to the Meishin Expressway, the route of the Keiji Bypass is longer than that of the Meishin Expressway.
Because there are no ⁇  facilities such as services in the service area, the Meishin Expressway is often constructed (there are two ⁇ s in the Otsu Service Area and the Katsura-gawa River ⁇  Area).
However, due to the fact that the structure of both the Seta Higashi and Oyamazaki stations were built after the god's name (especially the structure of the Oyamazaki- ⁇  Line), the operation was reduced by the LD system ( ⁇  Expressway).
There is an opinion that if you go from Oyamazaki Station to ⁇  Station or arrive at the left side of Meishin Expressway, you may join the Meishin Expressway.
Also, because there are many ⁇ s and slopes on the way, there are many ⁇ s that connect these roads, it is not fully equipped with the Meishin Expressway.
This road is a ⁇  for motor vehicles because it is a ⁇  of National Highway Route No. 1 (National Highway) and is not a high-speed drive route.
If you go from the east side of the Uji-gawa River to the Keiji Bypass of ⁇  and Kumiyama-cho, you must go to the west of Uji-nishi Interchange.
This is because the Ujihigashi Interchange is a ⁇ .
Therefore, during the ⁇  hours, general roads between the Ujihigashi Interchange and the Ujinishi Interchange are often included.
Because this general road section isn't underpassing, it is difficult to avoid ⁇ .

Located in the present Karasuma Shichijo, Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City, Higashi Hongan-ji Temple came to be called Higashi Hongan-ji Temple because it is located in the east of Nishi Hongan-ji Temple located on Horikawa-shichijo.
In 1987, Hongan-ji Temple as a religious corporation that had a relationship with Otani school and ⁇  was dissolved into a religious sect, and it was integrated into the sect.

Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is a god (Shinto) appearing in Japanese Mythology.
In the "Engishiki" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), 'Amateru' in the case of ⁇ -jinja Shrine is referred to as 'Amateru' in the "Engishiki" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers).
It is a godification of the sun and is considered to be one of the ancestors of the Imperial Family (Kososhin).
In "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), it is described as Amatsu ⁇  no kami (the god of Amaterasu Omikami, the sun goddess, in the heavenly rock cave), and in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), it is written as Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
It is also called Ohirume no michi no kami.
While in the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), multiple gods are described in the "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), they are unified under the name of 'Tenshodai okami' in the "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters).
Although she is a goddess, there is another theory that she was actually a male god.
As the name of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is used in political parts such as "Kotai Jingu ⁇ cho" ( ⁇  of the Ceremonies for Kotai-jingu Shrine) and so on, there is a theory that ⁇  was originally the ancestral deity of the Imperial family (Ko ⁇  no Mikoto) and Nishi ⁇  was the ancestor of the Imperial family and became Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
In Ise-jingu Shrine, it is usually called Amatsumara okami or Sume oomikami, and it is also called Amatsu kami okami no kami when chanting a name before a Shinto ritual.
At present, in academic documents, 'Takama' and 'Katakana' were written in hiragana (Japanese syllabary characters).
There is also a theory that it was written as 天 ⁇ 神 in ancient times.
Descriptions in▁mythology
According to "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), when Izanagi returned from the land of Izanami and washed ⁇ , he was born when he washed his left eye when he washed ⁇ .
At this time, she was called ⁇  no Mikoto, along with her right eye and nose, and she was called ⁇ ko.
At that time, Izanagi ordered Amaterasu Omikami to ⁇  Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).
Susanoo, who was entrusted with the sea, was exiled by Izanagi because he had been ⁇ ing that he wanted to go to the land of Izanami.
Susanoo met his older sister Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) before the conquest of Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains), but Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) thought that his younger brother, Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) would come to Takamanohara (plain of high heaven), and he was given an armed force.
In order to ⁇  Susano's ⁇ , five male gods were born from the real world of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and three goddesses were born from Susano's real fruit, and Susano won the victory.
Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) was born from the realities of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) was regarded as the following five gods.
Amenooshihomimimi
Amenohohi
Amatsuhikone
Irihikone
Kumanokusubi
Susanoo, who was ⁇  by this, worked for Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains) in Takamanohara (plain of high heaven), and as a result, Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) hid herself in the cave.
 ⁇  became apparent, and various misfortunes occurred.
Yaoyorozune no Mikoto, the god of Chichibu, and Ame no M ⁇  no Mikoto, the god of Ashihara no ⁇ , succeeded in driving Amaterasu Omikami from the rock cave, and Susano was exiled from Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).
Ame no M ⁇  no Mikoto sent his son, Amenooshihomi to ⁇  Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains).
 ⁇  no Mikoto was suppressed and ⁇  no Mikoto was ordered to ⁇  Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains), but Ninigi was born during the time of Ninigi's birth, Ninigi's grandson Ninigi's grandson Ninigi's grandson Ninigi.
The▁interpretation
In the mythology, there is a view that Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) was a ⁇  of the emperor by performing religious services (matsurigoto) in accordance with the instructions of the Emperor ⁇ , who was born earlier than him, and Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) was a ⁇  of the emperor itself.
There is also an opinion that it is a ⁇  of ancient shrine maiden.
Another name 'Hirume' is 'Hime no Onna' and it refers to a shrine maiden serving the sun god.
Although the sun god is originally a male god, there is a theory that a shrine maiden serving it was identified with the sun god and became a goddess.
There is also a theory that this goddess was established around the time of Empress Jito, or that Himiko was a model for Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
It is pointed out that the birth of 'moku' of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and Tsukuyomi no kami (the Sun Goddess) in the sun and Tsukuyomi no kami (the sun god of the moon) is described in "Reiho Gofu" ( ⁇  of Five Articles) ( ⁇  century) ( ⁇  the sixth century) of Taoism and "Kyoho Gofu" ( ⁇  of the Five Classics of Confucianism and Buddhism), and in "Keiho-kyo" ( ⁇  of Changes), it is pointed out that 'the eyes of the left eye are the moon and the moon,' and it is strongly influenced by Dokyo.
Also, it is said that the conception of the shrines and the shrines of Ise-jingu Shrine, such as Ise-jingu Shrine, Ise-jingu Shrine, Saigu-no-miya Shrine, ⁇ -no-Miya, ⁇ -no- ⁇ , ⁇ -no- ⁇ , ⁇ -no- ⁇ , ⁇ -no- ⁇ , ⁇ -no- ⁇ , ⁇ - ⁇ , and ⁇ -no-Miya, is a combination of the five colors, and Dokyo-jingu Shrine, which are associated with the Kotai-jingu Shrine.
In comparison, it is pointed out that the myth of the birth of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is almost equal to the Banko myth, which was recorded in ancient times (the third to fourth century).
Also, there is a theory that the myth of Tsukuyomi, which is the month of his eyes, spread throughout Asia, is a myth that it was introduced to Japan along with the races of the preceding periods.
According to one theory, in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), ⁇  transformed into three stages.
The following is a summary of the events and contents.
 ⁇ : The Taika Reforms were revised.
Before this, the Imperial Family did not follow Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
Hinokami' (the sun god) itself is called 'Hinokami' (the sun god).
It is widely believed that the male god who was called 'Ateruteru' was widely known.
In "Engishiki" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), there are shrines with the pronunciation of 'Amateru-jinja Shrine' in Tsushima as well as 'Amateru-jinja Shrine' in Tanba, 'Amateru-jinja Shrine' in Harima.
Incidentally, Amenomateru is another name for Amenohoakari, a grandson of Amaterasu, and Amenohoakari is the earliest ancestor of the Owari clan, the Tsumori clan and the Kaibe clan.
Also, the younger brother of Amenohokari was Ninigi, who was the grandson of Emperor Jinmu.
672: Jinshin▁War
It is also called 'Ohirume no michi' (literally, 'a woman who worships the sun god') or 'a woman who worships the sun god'.
In this case, there are two interpretations: one is that the enshrined deity is Ohiru, and the other is that it is 'Ateru' of the male god of snake.
 ⁇ : The Kotai-jingu Shrine was built.
She is 'the ancestor of Amaterasu' and 'the ancestor of the Imperial Family.'
She is a goddess.
It was created as a model for Empress Jito, and was created as a humanized god by nature.
After that, 'Tenteru' other than the Kososhin was called 'Amateruteru.'
For example, in "Izumo no kuni fudoki" (the topography of Izumo Province) (around 1060), the part of 'Amateru' is read as 'Amateru' and the part of 'Amateruhiko' in "Sendai ⁇ " (Ancient Japanese History) is also called 'Amateruhiko.'
1880-1881: The dispute over the enshrined deity of the Shinto ⁇  Shrine, which was established in ⁇  in Tokyo, occurred in Shinto circles.
Shinto ⁇  insisted that 'Izumo school' should be united with 'Yugen no kami' ( ⁇  of the world) and ' ⁇  no kami' ( ⁇  of the world) as the enshrined deities enshrined in the shrine of the ⁇  ( ⁇  of Shinto), and Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) as well as ' ⁇  no Kami.'
However, 'Ise-ha' (Ise school) which was the center of Shinto ⁇  (Shinto ⁇ ) was 'Tenchi Dai ⁇ ' (Great ⁇  of Heaven and Earth) which ruled the ⁇  world, and other gods opposed the idea of syncretization of Shinto with other subjects.
In the end, there were various theories, such as ' ⁇ -ha (the Izumo school) ⁇  the ⁇  of the ⁇  years from the age of the gods,' 'I should kill Senke-son Fuku, who had been ⁇  in the Imperial Family,' and so on.
Before long, this dispute was settled by the Emperor Meiji's decision (the Izumo faction was defeated) and the ⁇  of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) became the highest rank.
It is said that the government recognized the possibility of the creation of the creed system common in Shinto and that it was impossible to control the common people directly by the Fukko Shinto theory.
See the dispute on the enshrined deity of ⁇  Shinto Shrine.
 ⁇  ⁇  used another name, 'Ohiruchimuchi' when he appeared in his novel.
This is because the term ' ⁇  Omikami' (the Sun Goddess) comes from the fact that the ancestor gods appear in the text, so the sun god and the god of nature appear in the text, and the sun god is also called '大日 ⁇ 神' (大日 ⁇ ).
In fact, there is a description in ⁇ 's novel that he was not able to judge the ⁇ , the Battle of Nagashino, the Battle of Nagashino, and the Battle of Nagashino.
Masaatsu YASUOKA (1898 - 1983) who established Konkei Gakuin Gakko ( ⁇  Institute) said, 'There is a belief in Amaterasu Omikami in Japan.
Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is the ideal of ⁇ ing the world by the Japanese spirit.
In this way, Izanami and Izanagi stated that 'iza' in 'iza' was the ideal of the world's ⁇ , the pioneers of the world, and the pioneers of the world.'
Shrines that enshrine Amaterasu▁Omikami
The shrines that enshrine Amaterasu Omikami are called ⁇ -jinja Shrines all over the country, but the main shrine is Naiku (inner shrine) of Ise-jingu Shrine ( ⁇ -jingu Shrine).
Kotai-daijingu Shrine is one of the Three Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family that enshrines Yata no Kagami (also known as Yata no Kagami) as an enshrined deity.
Most of the shrines throughout Japan enshrine the Shinsatsu (Daijingu taima) of Kotai-jingu Shrine (Amateru-Daijingu Shrine).
Daimyo (Japanese territorial lord) is a term used to refer to the lord of a daimyo (Japanese feudal lord).
It also refers to a person who has a great name.
The name "tsuitoshi" is a small name.
Originally, a person who extended his power in the provinces told him to ⁇  his power.
Among them, in the samurai society, it became the word meaning a samurai who owned many territories and subordinates.
In the Muromachi period, shugo (provincial constables) strengthened their control over their own territories and became shugo daimyo (shugo, which were Japanese provincial military governors, that became daimyo, which were Japanese feudal lords).
During the Sengoku period (period of warring states), a large feudal lord who established his governing territory appeared and was called Kokujin (local samurai) or Sengoku daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period).
During the Edo period, the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) gave shoryo (territory) of more than 10,000 koku (approximately 1.8 million liters of crop yield) to the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
Among samurai with a stipend of less than 10,000 koku, samurai under the direct control of the bakufu were called jikisan.
Since feudal lords share the character of feudal lords in common with lords in China, they were treated as daimyo (Japanese feudal lords) by ⁇ ing feudal lords.
This section describes the details of the early-modern daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) in the Edo period.
For details on shugo daimyo (shugo, which were Japanese provincial military governors, that became daimyo, which were Japanese feudal lords) and Sengoku daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period), refer to the article on the above.
 ⁇ -ji▁Temple
The status of ⁇  was determined according to Kakaku (family status), Kani official rank, Karoku (hereditary stipend), post, and ⁇ seki ( ⁇  rank next to the three Empresses: Great Empress Dowager, Empress Dowager, and Empress).
Firstly, due to the relationship with the Tokugawa Shogun family, it was classified into the Oie family (Shinpan, Shinpan daimyo), Fudai daimyo (hereditary vassals of the Tokugawa family) who had been vassals of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara, Fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) and Fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) who were mainly vassals of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara.
The first shogun, Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, in order to maintain the existence of the shogun family, was allowed to keep the existence of the Tokugawa family, ⁇ ing the control of daimyo throughout the country, and to assist the Shogun family, and established a system of granting the nine sons, Yoshinao TOKUGAWA, the ninth son, to the Owari Domain, and Yorifusa TOKUGAWA to the Kishu Domain and the Mito Domain, respectively.
In addition, Ieyasu appointed Hideyasu YUKI, the second son of the second Shogun Hidetada TOKUGAWA, to the Echizen Domain, as well as daimyo (feudal lord) of the Tokugawa family all over the country.
In addition, fudai daimyo (hereditary vassals to the Tokugawa family) who had established the Tokugawa Shogun family for generations were appointed to Fudai daimyo (hereditary vassals of the Tokugawa family) as fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family), and in order to secure military power of the bakufu, they were appointed important posts, such as Tairo (chief minister) of the bakufu, and assisted the shogunate government.
The fudai daimyo (hereditary vassals to the Tokugawa family) were relatively low, and the fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) with a large stipend of 350,000 koku (approximately 1.8 million liters of crop yield) of rice crop yield, including the Torii clan, the ⁇ bara clan, the Honda clan, the Honda clan, and the Ogasawara clan, were relatively large, but in the Edo period, the Sakai clan, the Abe clan, the ⁇  clan, the ⁇  clan, the ⁇  clan, the ⁇  clan, the ⁇  clan, the ⁇  clan, and the Toda clan.
This became the reason for separation of power and military power.
The tozama daimyo (nonhereditary feudal lord) after the Battle of Sekigahara were subordinate daimyos, and many of them were opposed to the Tokugawa family in the Battle of Sekigahara.
For this reason, the defense of the bakufu was strong, and if a secret agent was actively engaged in ⁇ , it was severely punished by being deprived of his fief.
The major tozama daimyo included the Kaga Domain, the Satsuma Domain, the Satsuma Domain, the Sendai Domain, the Sendai Domain, the Sendai Domain, the Sendai Domain, the Kira clan, the Kira clan, the Uesugi clan, the Uesugi clan, the Yonezawa Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Tosa Yamauchi Domain, the Tosa Domain, and the Akita Domain.
In addition, a daimyo's social status was divided according to the status of a daimyo whose territory was more than one province or more, and those who had a castle were called joshu daimyo (lordless feudal lord) or joshu (lord chamberlain) who were not allowed to enter the castle were called jinya, and those who were not allowed to enter Edo-jo Castle were also classified according to their social status.
For details, refer to the section on ⁇ seki.
Daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) who had the level of the daimyo (Japanese territorial lord) with a fief of 100,000 koku (approximately 1.8 million liters of crop yield) owned almost all the territories of the daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) possessing 100,000 koku (approximately 1.8 million liters of crop yield) and the territories of the daimyo (Japanese territorial lord) in the Sengoku period (period of warring states) in the Sengoku period (period of warring states) (period of warring states).
In the case of ⁇ , one village was divided into another feudal lord and the other feudal lord ( ⁇ kyu).
Daimyo (feudal lord) had more than 10,000 koku in principle, but the Kirengawa Domain of the ⁇  clan was 5,000 koku.
This is because the ⁇  clan was descended from the Ashikaga clan.
Daimyo were controlled by the bakufu by the system of ⁇  (three privileged branches of Tokugawa family) and ⁇  (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo) under the system of ⁇  (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo).
In addition, there were many cases in which daimyo were forced to defend the coastal defense at the time of the Edo period or in the end of the Edo period, because they were called Miteden (or Miteden).

Daimyo- ⁇  (feudal lord's retainers) with a fine pattern.
In the " ⁇ yoshu" (a dictionary compiled in the Muromachi period) in the Muromachi period, two sounds of 'taimei' and 'daimyo' were used, and the former indicated the meaning of Shugo (provincial constable) (Daisho) and the latter was ⁇ mochi (Fuyuso).
In the Sengoku period (period of warring states), the distinction between the meanings of the meanings of the Chinese characters became ⁇ , and it is said that the word 'taimei' was often used.
In the early 17th century, two sounds of 'daimyo' and 'taimei' were also published in the Japanese- ⁇  dictionary, but the distinction between words was not clear and the distinction between words was not clear, and the two were regarded as a major feudal lord.
The reason why the word 'daimyo' came to be commonly used in the Kansei Reforms was from the Kansei Reforms, and during the Kansei era, it was called 'Myomyo.'
