Even if it is not completed by achieving a certain level of enlightenment, even if it is not completed, it is the essence of Buddha's ascetic practices to seek enlightenment (Shusho Ichinyo), Shaka, Shaka, and Zazen, and it is the highest ascetic training to attain enlightenment.
Many of Kamakura Buddhism ⁇  the Tachikawa-ryu school, but in "Shogenzuimonki" ( ⁇  of the True ⁇  of the True ⁇  of the True ⁇  of the True ⁇  of the True ⁇  of the True ⁇ ) there is no description about it.

It is the ⁇  of all people's Buddhism.
He preached Mappo (Age of the ⁇  Dharma) to deny Mappo (Age of the ⁇  Dharma) and deny Mappo (Age of the ⁇  Dharma) based on Mappo (Age of the ⁇  Dharma) as opposed to Mappo (Age of the ⁇  Dharma) because he was just a disciple of Shaka's period.

Umekoji Steam ⁇  Museum is an exhibition facility for steam locomotives managed by West Japan Railway Company (JR West) in Kankiji-cho, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.
On October 10, 1972, it was opened to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Japan's opening of Japan National Railways ( ⁇ ) to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Japan's opening of Japan National Railways, and it was the first facility to preserve steam locomotives as precious cultural properties and preserve them.
JR West succeeded to JR West due to the division and privatization of JNR in 1987.
This facility itself is an active car base (Umekoji ⁇  Operation Center) and has been ⁇ ed and tested by JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series ⁇  and diesel locomotives owned by the Sagano Scenic Railway.
In the first place, the development of steam locomotives rapidly disappeared from the latter half of the 1960s.
At first, because it was close to Kashihara City, Tochigi Prefecture, it was the most likely candidate for the ⁇ -ku Ward, which was located in Oyama Station, Tochigi Prefecture, but when it was located in 'the central part of Japan' it was decided that Umekoji-ku Ward (at that time) was located in the vicinity of 'the central part of Japan,' Umekoji-ku Ward was officially selected as a preservation district in 1970.
Although it was decided that the existing cars should be selected as the oldest existing cars ( ⁇  1) in principle, there were some cars that were not supposed to be preserved at first, such as C6262 model No.2.
The facility consists of the "SL Exhibition Hall" which uses a fan-shaped structure of the former Umekoji-ku Ward, and the " ⁇  Exhibition Hall," which was reconstructed and restored by the former Nijo Station house.
A Sensu-type ⁇  was made of reinforced concrete built in 1914, and it was designated as a national important cultural property along with five-toned ⁇  ceilings (completed in 1915) and pullerails on December 10, 2004.
In 2004, it was selected as a civil engineering worker for civil engineering selection of civil engineering.
In 2006, the old Nijo Station building ( ⁇  Exhibition Hall), the ⁇ -type train-car train-car train-cars, the one-car train-car train-car train-cars, the one-car train-cars, and the repairs were designated as the semi- ⁇  railway- ⁇  railway.
The former Nijo Station building, built in 1904 by the Kyoto Electric Railway as the head office building, was the oldest two-storey Japanese-style Japanese-style building in Japan, and was built in front of Heian-jingu Shrine in consideration of the landscape.
Kyoto Electric Railway was ⁇  in 1907 and subsequently used as a station for the section between Nijo Station ( ⁇  Line) and Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) in 1996, but it ended its role as an elevated station building on the Sanin Main Line ( ⁇  Line) between Nijo Station ( ⁇  Line), Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) in 1996, and its interior was moved and reconstructed in 1997 to the site of the main building and reconstructed in 1997 to preserve the old buildings.
It was designated as a cultural property by Kyoto City in April 1996.
18 sets of 118 domestic steam locomotives manufactured from the Taisho period to the Showa period (at the beginning of the opening, 116 tanks) were housed and exhibited.
In the early days of the opening of the museum, the C5353-car trains and C51-type C51-type steam locomotives were registered by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, but after that, seven-car trains, which have been stored for the maintenance of storage, have been conducted several times, and seven-car sets, as of▁2006.
Of the five types of trains, two cars (C57 type, C57 ⁇ ) are still registered on the main line, and two trains (C57 type, C56 ⁇ ) are served by ' ⁇  (train)' on the Yamaguchi Line, ' ⁇  (train)' on the Hokuriku Main Line and 'Kita- ⁇  (train)' on the Hokuriku Main Line.
It is impossible to run on the main line because there are no ⁇ s except for these two cars, and no inspections are conducted in general, so it's impossible to run on the main line.
Also, the 'SL team' train-cars, which are stored in the museum, are operated by the rails in the museum.
Although this display track used to be located at the northern end of a large parking lot (which once had a large-size parking lot in the building) from the depot to the north of the ⁇  depot, the current Umekoji-koen Park was moved to the north of the premises of the station building, and the current Umekoji-koen Station was moved to the present-day Umekoji-koen Station.
Even today, it has a function as an institution, and is connected with a commercial line.
Furthermore, after the operation of Takatori factory of West Japan Railway Company (JR West) was closed, steam locomotives have been preserved.
Japanese▁plum
It originates from 'Ume' which means Umekoji.
All trains except the C62 model No. 62, which had been designated in 1976, were designated as semi- ⁇  railway by the Ministry of Land, ⁇ , Transport and Tourism in▁2006.
The procedures that do not have special descriptions are made in 1972 from the above-mentioned institutions belonging to the organization.
Umekoji Station has no registered address since the preservation of Umekoji Station.

Shomyo is one of Japanese traditional music.
It is a religious music that is used for rites and festivals.
It is also called Bonbai or Bonnoku in Japan.
In the old ⁇ , it is written as  ⁇  in hiragana (Japanese syllabary characters).
It is one of the academic fields (gomyo or gomyo).
Five subjects of Confucianism refer to five kinds of shomyo (chanting of Buddhist commandments), shomyo (chanting of Letters, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology), myobomyo ( ⁇  of medicine), Inmyo ( ⁇  of medical science), and Naimyo (students of Buddhism).
It was introduced into Japan along with the introduction of Buddhism to Japan.
There is a record that a Buddhist memorial service was held in ⁇  when the Great Buddha of Todai-ji Temple was held, and it is thought that Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) was actively performed in the Nara period.
In the early Heian period, Saicho and Kukai transmitted Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) to form the basis of Tendai Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) and Shingon Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant).
Even Buddhist sects other than the Tendai sect and Shingon sect have their own Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) of each sect, and they have been handed down to the present day.
Since Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) passed down in oral teachings, there was no evidence to prove it.
Therefore, ⁇  was extremely difficult.
Later, hakase (master of astronomy) was invented as tenmon hakase (master of astronomy).
Also, technical terms such as hakase vary depending on each school.
However, hakase is a reference in order to recite Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s), and in order to learn Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s), it is necessary to acquire and inherit the teachings from master to disciple, and it is impossible to maintain and inherit the teachings of Buddha from master to disciple.
Therefore, the development of leaders and successors was required.
As a result of various conditions, many schools disappeared.
The Tendai Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) was introduced by Saicho, and developed independently.
After Saicho, Ennin and Annen flourished.
 ⁇ , the founder of ⁇ -ji Temple, is known as the Chuko no So (father of restoration).
In ⁇ , ⁇  built ⁇ -in Temple ( ⁇  Ward, Kyoto City) in Ohara, Kyoto.
The sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Gyozan of ⁇ -in Temple in Ohara, and is modeled after Mt. Gyozan in China.
Later, ⁇ -in Temple and Shoko-in Temple became known as the training hall for Shomyo Nenbutsu (Buddhist liturgical chant) of Ohara-ryu School.
Later, Jakugen formed a group, and in Ohara there was a statement of Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) of the two schools.
Later, ⁇  revived Ohara Shomyo (chanting of Ohara).
Tanchi developed the trend based on the new music theory.
Since then, he established the center of Tendai Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) and inherited the present Tendai Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant).
Shomyo Nenbutsu, Jodo Shu, Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) and Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) are the lineages of Tendai Shomyo.
Shingon Shomyo (chanting of Shingon Buddhism) originated from Kukai, which led to the foundation of the Shingon Ritsu sect.
It was after the mid-Edo period that Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ ) was ⁇ .
 ⁇  can be said to have been one of the Chuko no So (father of restoration).
He strived to compose and improve Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ ).
There were many schools until the Kamakura period, but four schools (Honsoin-ryu, Shinpo-in-ryu, Daigo-ryu, Daigo-ryu, and ⁇ -ryu) were established by Cloistered Imperial Prince Kakusho.
The Shomyo of the Kogi Shingon sect declined and disappeared during the Edo period.
Honpoin-ryu, Shinpo-in-ryu, Daigo-ryu and Daigo-ryu were abolished in the early Meiji period.
Currently, it is divided into Chizan Shomyo (Mt. Chizan in Kyoto), Buzan Shomyo (Mt. ⁇ -dera Temple in Nara), Nanzanshin-ryu school (Mt. Koya, Mt. Koya, Koyasan Shingon sect temple in Kyoto) and Kogi Shingon sect.
The Shomyo Nenbutsu (Buddhist liturgical chant) of Chizan Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant), Shingon sect Chizan school and Shingon sect ⁇  school of Shingonshu sect are derived from the Nakagawa Daishin school.
 ⁇  gave shelter to the old school of Daigo.
In 1583, when Negoro-ji Temple ( ⁇  Prefecture) was burned down by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI, the Negoro-ji Temple and Mt. Toyoyama were merged into the school based on the old school of Daigo.
 ⁇ istically, it is called 'rongi' or 'shomyo' in Mt. ⁇ .
The Nakagawa Oshin school of the Nanzan Shingi Shingon sect (Kogi Shingon sect Shomyo) became the original school.
Nakagawa Oshin-ryu school was founded by Oishin at Nakagawa-dera Temple in Nara Prefecture.
During the Teiei era (1232 - ⁇ ), Shoshin of Mt. Koya and Sanbo-in Temple moved his base to Mt. Koya.
Later, he changed his name to Mt. Koya, which was another name for Mt. Koya, to Mt. Nanshin-ryu.
He was the founder of the ⁇  school and the Noshin school.
The music of Joruri ( ⁇  narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment), Yokyoku (Noh song), Joruri ( ⁇  narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment), Joruri ( ⁇  narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment), Joruri ( ⁇  narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment) and Joruri ( ⁇  narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment) can be said to have changed the form of Shomyo.
It had a great influence on ⁇  music.

He was the 38th Emperor.
His ⁇  (a posthumous name given to a person who has died or has entered the priesthood) was Ame no M ⁇  no Mikoto.
His posthumous name was ⁇  (or Katsuragi).
It is thought that he was called Katsuragi no Miko or Katsuragi no Miko while he was alive.
He is generally known as Naka no Oe no Oji (also known as Naka no Oe no Oji).
Oe' means the crown prince, and 'Naka no Oe' means 'the next crown prince.'
▁Summary

And he established the era name Taika and implemented various reforms (the Taika Reforms, the Taika Reforms).
In addition, he was sentenced to death in an attempt to cause a coup d' ⁇  in later years, such as the Decree for the Restoration of Imperial Rule and so on.
Because Baekje was destroyed by the Tang Dynasty and Silla Dynasty in ⁇ , he sent ⁇  FUYO, a son of the King of Paekche who stayed in the Imperial Court, to revive Baekje.
He stayed in Tsukushi to command Baekje, but in 661, Empress Saimei passed away.
After that, he continued to ⁇  the Imperial Throne for a long time, but in 663, he moved the capital to Otsu City and ascended the throne there.
After the Battle of Shiramura, as a part of the policy of national defense, he set up mizu-shiro (castles built on lakes or ⁇ es for defensive reasons) and sakimori (firemen).
In addition, there were reforms such as the reform of the system reform in the 19th and 16th levels of cap rank.
In 670, he made ' ⁇  Nenjaku Nenjaku', the oldest national family register in Japan.
According to "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), Emperor Tenchi handed over the throne to his first prince, Prince Otomo.
However, in the Jinshin War that broke out after the death of Emperor Tenchi, his younger brother, Prince Oama (Emperor Tenmu) succeeded to the throne and ascended the throne.
After that, Emperor Shotoku, who was from the line of Emperor Tenmu, succeeded to the throne.
After ⁇ 's death, Emperor Tenchi's grandson, ⁇  no okimi ascended the throne as Emperor Konin, and after that, it became the line of Emperor Tenchi.
It is said that he sent four of his four daughters to Prince Oama as a hostage because of Prince Oama's false charges.
Brief Personal▁History
626: He was born.
The Crown Prince was formally installed as the Crown Prince on July 12, ⁇ .
Saimei (August 24, 661) - Shosei system (a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code)
On February 20, ⁇ , Emperor Tenchi ascended the throne.
On January 7, 672, he died at the age of 46.
(There is a theory in " ⁇ " (The Mirror of the Present) that says he died of illness, 'There is a theory that he was killed in a mountain where he was killed by the Emperor Tenmu side because he was killed in the mountains of Mt. Sanryo after the assassination of the Emperor Keiko.)
It is one of the ⁇ s in the political history of the late seventh century that Emperor Tenchi did not ascend to the throne for a long time.
There are several views on this matter.
In consideration of the Emperor Tenmu's influence.
In other words, it is ⁇  that Emperor Tenmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi, and it is based on the theory that he was a prince of the Han Dynasty who was born before Empress Kogyoku married Emperor Jomei, and that he was a different father of Emperor Tenchi.
In fact, if the year of Emperor Tenmu's death was calculated based on the age of Emperor Tenmu in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) and part of "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), the year of Emperor Tenmu was the longest period.
However, there are many historical materials in which there are no contradictions between the same historical materials, and there are many historical materials about the age of eight to nine.
On the other hand, according to the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), the age of Emperor Tenchi, who was sixteen years older than his father, died when he was sixteen years old, appeared in the 'Nihon Shoki' (Chronicles of Japan) because 'if he was a younger brother of his older brother,' although he was a younger brother.
Therefore, the year of birth of "Honcho koin jounroku" (the Emperor's family tree, made in the Muromachi period) was introduced in 1414.
A counterargument with "In ancient times, Emperor Tenchi, Emperor Tenchi and Emperor ⁇ , whose reign was not unusual in ancient times, also ⁇  the Shosei system, and did not ascend to the throne immediately.
(In fact, there was a slight difference between them.)
There is an opposing argument with "Nihon Shoki" (Chronicles of Japan) and other history books which have been pointed out as 'Nihon Shoki' (Chronicles of Japan) have different characteristics, so some say that it is impossible to deal with the same.
(Refer to the section on 'Emperor Tenmu's age')
There is a theory that Prince Karu was a coup d' ⁇  by Karu no Miko (Emperor Kotoku), and Naka no Oe no Oji was driven from his position.
Recently, it has been pointed out that the relationship between Prince Naka no Oe and Emperor ⁇  was relatively good, and it is pointed out that the basic policy was similar to that of Prince Naka no Oe.
In this way, Naka no Oe no Oji ⁇  Iruka's murder.
In addition, based on the description in the Taika Reforms in Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan), this theory was advocated.
Also, this theory attracts attention because of the reasons for the abdication of Emperor Kogyoku and the reason why the Soga clan other than Iruka was exiled even after the coup d' ⁇ .
There is a theory that the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi was opposed to the female relationship of Emperor Tenchi.
This is based on the fact that Emperor Kotoku, who was described in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), presented poems to his wife, Imperial Princess ⁇  (Emperor Tenchi's great-great-grandson), which was described in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), ⁇  relations between her and Emperor Tenchi.
Although the love and marriage of SOGA no Iruka were allowed to marry each other, the situation at that time was due to a love affair among the sisters of SOGA no Iruka at that time, but in the story of Ame no M ⁇  no ⁇  (one of the three Empresses: Great Empress Dowager, Empress Dowager, Empress Dowager, and Empress) by Mariko RINARI no ⁇ , it was pointed out that they were involved in the relationship with her uncle Karu no okimi (the great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandson of Emperor Kotoku), who had a relationship with her uncle Karu no okimi (the great-great-great-great-great-grandson of Emperor Kotoku).
After the death of Empress Saimei, there was a theory that ⁇  no Himemiko succeeded to the Imperial Throne as the consort of the previous emperor, but some records were ⁇  due to some reasons.
This is a theory advocated in "Manyoshu" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) that advocates a person called 'Naka no Mikoto' as 'Naka no Mikoto' (Emperor ⁇ ) in "Manyoshu" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) and that 'Naka no Mikoto' can be interpreted as a successor to the Emperor until the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi.
If ⁇  no Himemiko is referred to as 'Naka no Mikoto' as 'Naka no Mikoto', there is a view that she was especially called 'Naka no Mikoto'; however, there is no doubt that she was Empress Saimei.
Due to the nature of political history and restrictions on historical materials, it is difficult to prove, but the research has been progressing in the future, including the collaboration with ⁇ 's results.

Four of his poems were selected for "Manyoshu" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) and " ⁇  Hyakunin Isshu" (the Anthology of One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Poets).

During the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, ⁇  SAIONJI, the son of Kinmune, served the Northern Court (Japan) and became Udaijin (Minister of the Right), and restored the family name.
During the Muromachi and Edo periods, it flourished as a family business for biwa (Japanese lute).
During the Muromachi period, ⁇  SAIONJI invited Tadataka HOSOKAWA, the heir of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA (later disinherited) and Kyumu ⁇ , the first daughter of Kyumu ⁇ , to the position of ⁇  (Minister of the Sovereign's Household), but ⁇  did not allow him to become ⁇  (Minister of the Sovereign's Household) to be appointed to the position of Sadaijin (Minister of the Left), and he gave 600 koku (approximately 1.8 million liters of crop yield) to the Saionji family.

It is written in  ⁇  style using Manyo-gana (a form of syllabary used in the Manyo-gana (a form of syllabary used in the Manyo-shu [Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves]), and it is often written as  ⁇ , but it reflects the ⁇  of the decline of the Nakanokanpaku family and the death of his lord Teishi, Teishi/Sadako, which reflects the ⁇  of grief.
The sophisticated sensibility of the author and the sharp observation of the "Genji Monogatari" (The Tale of Genji) was combined, and the beauty of the ' ⁇ ' of "Genji Monogatari" (The Tale of Genji) was inspired by the ' ⁇ ' beauty of the ' ⁇ ' world.

According to "Makura no Soshi" (The Pillow Book), "Makura no soshi" (The Pillow Book) was deeply loved by human beings and nature, and was created as the beauty of various kinds of colors.
In the next chapter of each chapter, there is no distinction between ⁇ s, zuiso ( ⁇ s) and zuiso ( ⁇ s) in each chapter, so that the ingredients of tenmaku ( ⁇ s of horses) are ⁇  by the expression of ' ⁇ ' (written as  ⁇  in Japanese) (written as  ⁇  in Japanese).

It was the ⁇  of Teishi's ⁇  to Chugu Teishi.
It was written in order to calm the soul of Teishi, who died while the ⁇  of Michitaka's family declined.
Therefore, it is a matter of course that Michitaka's family declined (same as above).
Even in the era when people who took care of chugu (the second consort of an emperor) and chugu (the second consort of an emperor) were disappointed, they insisted that they lived in the world of love and good fortune ( ⁇ ).

According to the ' ⁇  of Civilization in ⁇ ' of Teishi's kokyu (empress's residence), it was not written by the qualification of ' ⁇ ' ( ⁇ tsugu ISHIDA).
Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA was the 15th Seii Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) (his reign was from December 5, 1866 to December 9, 1867).
He was the only shogun who did not carry out his duty as Shogun in Edo-jo Castle.
He was Naidaijin (Minister of the Center) with the rank of Juichii (Junior First Rank) and the First Order of Merit.
He was a member of Kizokuin (the House of Peers).
After the death of the 14th Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA, who acted as Shogun's guardian, he became the 15th Shogun of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
After the Emperor Meiji returned political power (= Taisei Hokan [transfer of power back to the Emperor]), he aimed at kobu- ⁇  ( ⁇  of the imperial court and the shogunate government]), but in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi and Fushimi-jo Castles after the Restoration of Imperial Rule, he was ordered by the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) to hunt down and kill Edo-jo Castle and ordered the Imperial Court to surrender Edo-jo Castle without blood.
When he was confined to his house during the Meiji period, he devoted himself to his ⁇  and lived until the Taisho period as a prince.
Yoshinobu' is also read as 'Yoshinonobu' or 'Keiki' as his common name.
While he was in office as shogun, his official document of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) was recorded as 'Yoshihisa.'
Her name is also written as ' ⁇ ' in English and in English- ⁇  newspaper.
Although he is often called 'Yoshinobu' in his hometown Mito City, he is often called 'Keiki' in his childhood.
According to a person who knows Yoshinobu while he was still alive, Yoshinobu himself seemed to be fond of 'Keiki-sama' and he called himself 'Keiki' to his younger brother Akitabu TOKUGAWA.
It is said that Yoshinobu's successor, ⁇  TOKUGAWA, was also called 'Keikyu-sama' by people around the same time as Yoshinobu.
Although the two names of 'Keiki-sama' and 'Keiki-san' can be confirmed in modern times, the term 'Keiki-san' is rarely found in Shizuoka Prefecture, and the term 'Keiki-san' is often used even in the case of either case.
Although there are many people who call it "Keiki" as 'there is a lot of people involved in the exile of the Higo Domain,' there is a possibility that the use of the use of the members of the Higo Domain who were engaged in the overthrowing the Shogunate in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi may have been ⁇  or ⁇ .
On October 29, ⁇ , he was born as the seventh son of ⁇  KUKI, the ninth lord of the Mito Domain in Edo.
His mother was Princess Yoshiko (Yoshiko, the third Shogun, Iemitsu TOKUGAWA's lawful wife) whose lawful wife was Princess Yoshiko.
However, Iemitsu's real mother is said to be Oe no kata, the legal wife of her father Hidetada, but some say that Kasuga no Tsubone was the real mother of Kasuga no Tsubone.
His childhood name was ⁇ maro.
According to Nariaki's educational policy, he moved to Mito Domain for seven months after his birth, and taught many studies and martial arts from Seisai EIZAWA and others to the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family.
He seemed to have been ⁇  by Yoshinobu at that time, and at first, Nariaki did not have an adopted child to another family, so he thought that he would remain in the care of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA, his eldest son (the eldest son) and ⁇  TOKUGAWA.
On September 1, ⁇ , ⁇  was ordered by the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) to inherit ⁇ maro from Mito Domain to the heir of the Hitotsubashi family.
In response to this, ⁇ maro returned to the Hitotsubashi family on September 1, and in December, he was granted a portion of the real name of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA from the 12th Shogun Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA.
Ieyoshi often visited the Hitotsubashi residence, and considered Yoshinobu as an influential candidate for Shogun's heir, but he gave up receiving advice from roju (member of shogun's council of elders) Masahiro ABE.
In 1853, during the confusion in the ⁇  of the Black Ships, Ieyoshi died of illness, and Iesada TOKUGAWA, the 13th Shogun, who succeeded Ieyoshi, was sickly and a son of the 13th Shogun Iesada TOKUGAWA, became apparent (the issue of the Shogun's successor).
The Hitotsubashi group, consisting of Nariaki TOKUGAWA and Masahiro ABE, the lord of the Satsuma Domain, Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA, and Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA, the lord of the Kishu Domain, were incorporated into the ⁇  group of the O-oku (the inner halls of Edo Castle where the wife of the Shogun and her servants reside) with Nariaki TOKUGAWA, the lord of the Kishu Domain, Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA, and the biological mother of Iesada.
The Hitotsubashi group tried to put Tenshoin, the adopted daughter of Nariakira SHIMAZU, in O-oku (the inner halls of Edo Castle where the wife of the Shogun and her servants reside), into O-oku (the inner halls of Edo Castle where the wife of the Shogun and her servants reside), but after Masahiro ABE and Nariakira SHIMAZU died one after another, the Tairo (chief minister) Naosuke II, who became Tairo (chief minister) died in 1858, agreed to ' ⁇  TOKUGAWA, the heir to the Shogun.'
In the same year, Naosuke II signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan without imperial sanction.
Yoshinobu, together with Nariaki, the lord of Fukui Domain, Nariaki TOKUGAWA, and others, ⁇ ed Nariaki TOKUGAWA, but in the following year, 1859, he was ordered to retire and be confined to his house (An Ansei no Taigoku).
When Yoshinobu himself did not want to become heir to the Shogun, he sent a letter to Nariaki saying 'I don't want to do it, but I do not want to do so because of his failure in the world.'
In 1860, he was suspended from office.
In 1862, Imperial envoy ⁇  ⁇ , a guard of Satsuma Domain led by Hisamitsu SHIMAZU, went to Edo and ordered Emperor Komei to appoint Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA as Shogun's guardian and appoint him as Tairo (chief minister).
On July 6, the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) appointed Yoshinobu as the guardian of the shogun, and ⁇  as the president of political affairs.
Yoshinobu and ⁇  implemented the reformation of the shogunate government called Bunkyu Reform, and established Kyoto ⁇  (Military governor of Kyoto) and ⁇  (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo) and ⁇  (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo).
In 1863, he went up to Kyoto as an attendant to Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA, and played an important role in negotiations with the Imperial Court against the expulsion of foreigners.
When Emperor Komei visited Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine to pray for the expulsion of foreigners by prayer for the expulsion of foreigners in prayer for the expulsion of foreigners, he was ordered by the Emperor to carry out joi (expulsion of foreigners) by the Emperor to carry out joi (expulsion of excluding foreigners) by the Emperor and expel foreigners, so he ordered Iemochi to have an audience with him.
When the Sonno Joi ha (supporters of the doctrine of restoring the emperor and expelling the barbarians) led by the Choshu clan broke out in the Coup of August 18 (September 18 under the old lunar calendar), he went to Kyoto again to join the Sanyo-kaigi (councilor of state) with the support of Kobu-Gattai ( ⁇  of the imperial court and the shogunate) and Sa- ⁇  ( ⁇  of the shogunate).
However, judging from the fact that the conference was held by the council, he was drunk at a drinking party with Imperial Prince Kuninomiya ⁇  and getting drunk at a drinking party, ⁇ ing ⁇ -jo Castle, ⁇ -jo Castle, ⁇ -jo Castle, and ⁇ -jo Castle, and furthermore, he tried to break up the political system by saying 'I'm going to the Shimazu family.'
After that, he was appointed to Kinri Goshuei Sotoku (Governor-General of the Imperial Palace Guard) by the Imperial Court in Kyoto, and along with ⁇  MATSUDAIRA (the lord of Aizu Domain), ⁇  MATSUDAIRA (the lord of Aizu Domain), ⁇  MATSUDAIRA (the lord of Kuwana Domain), and ⁇  MATSUDAIRA (the lord of Kuwana Domain), he was a pro-Imperialist and court nobles (Ichibashi, Aizu and Kuwana Domains).
During the Tenguto no Ran ( ⁇  of Tenguto), he showed his coolness to cut down the vassals of his parents and Mito Domain, including ⁇ sai TAKEDA, who supported Yoshinobu.
In 1864, he attacked the army of bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) at the Kinmon Incident, and attacked the Choshu army which occupied Takatsukasa's residence.
Following this, he was involved in the first conquest of Choshu, and worked hard for the Imperial sanction of the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan, and succeeded in obtaining imperial sanction on the condition of the condition.
In the second conquest of Choshu in 1866, Yoshinobu received an imperial order to attack Choshu by suppressing the Satsuma Domain's ⁇ .
However, due to the rejection of the Satsuma clan's dispatch of troops to Satsuma, the bakufu army was defeated.
On August 20, during the second conquest of Choshu, Shogun Iemochi died in Osaka-jo Castle.
Yoshinobu took the Imperial Court's movement to ⁇  the imperial rescript and concluded a peace agreement.
Although Iemochi was recommended to succeed Iemochi, Yoshinobu refused this proposal.
On August 20, the Tokugawa Shogun family inherited the position of Shogun, but he refused to assume the position of Shogun.
Later, roju (member of shogun's council of elders) and other roju (member of shogun's council of elders) asked Katamori MATSUDAIRA, but they did not accept it, and on December 5, they became Shogun by the recommendation of the Emperor Komei.
This was because he was forced to become a shogun by selling favors, and there was a rumor that he would take advantage of politics.
Yoshinobu received an assistance of 240 million dollars from France through Leon Léon, the French minister, and established ⁇  Seitetsusho (a trading house) and Shusensho (a government office in charge of casting and appraising of gold during the Edo period), and implemented the military system of military affairs, including Jurrene Brene.
Also, he encouraged his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA to study in Europe, such as sending his younger brother Akitaka TOKUGAWA to Paris.
At the problem of the opening of Hyogo port, he insisted on the Imperial Court and obtained permission from the Imperial Court.
Yoshinobu, who was ⁇  to 'the secret imperial command to attack the shogunate' to the Satsuma and Choshu clans, reported to the Imperial Court on October 14, 1867 (the Taisei Hokan [transfer of power back to the Emperor]).
It is said that the Imperial Court at that time had no administrative ability, and it was under the leadership of the parliamentary council, which led to the existence of the Tokugawa government.
However, due to Toshimichi OKUBO and Tomomi IWAKURA's plan to overthrow the Shogunate, the Decree for the Restoration of Imperial Rule was issued in December, and Yoshinobu was ordered to 'jikannochi' ( ⁇  dismissal and ⁇  of the Tokugawa family).
Yoshinobu left Osaka-jo Castle in order to avoid conflict, provoked the ministers of foreign countries and insisted on the Tokugawa ⁇  (three privileged branches of Tokugawa family) and submitted a petition to the Imperial Court to change the Jikan nochi to the Imperial Court.
However, in the following year, 1868, when the Satsuma Domain was taking part in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, he raised an army and attacked Kyoto using Aizu and Kuwana Domain soldiers.
However, when the army of the former bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) was ⁇  in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi on January 3 (January 3 under the old lunar calendar) when the Battle of Toba-Fushimi broke out, he left the military force and retreated to Edo in "Kaiyo Maru" (Kaiyo Maru Warship).
Soon after, the order to track down and kill Yoshinobu as the Emperor's enemy was issued, and the Imperial army, which was led by Dai Sotoku (Governor-General of the Dazai-fu [local government office in Kyushu region]), led by Dai Sotoku-fu (Commander-in-Chief of the Great Governor-General of the Dazai-fu [local government office in Kyushu region]), started the east expedition.
Yoshinobu insisted on ⁇ ing his allegiance by suppressing the resistance force led by ⁇  ⁇ .
In February, he left the situation to Kaishu KATSU and was ordered to be placed under house arrest at Daijiin of Ueno Kanei-ji Temple.
Also, the head of the Tokugawa family was adopted by Kamenosuke TAYASU (later Tatsunosuke TOKUGAWA), his adopted son.
When the negotiations with Takamori SAIGO, staff officer of the government army, and Takamori SAIGO, who had no blood relationship with Edo-jo Castle, were forced to surrender, Yoshinobu's treatment was moved to Mito, and he stayed in the room of ⁇ dokan, a ⁇  (domain school).
In July, he moved to Sunpu where the Tokugawa family was transferred.

He did not sleep well, and when his father, Imperial Princess Kazunomiya ⁇ , was sleeping in bed as a problem in the succession of the Tokugawa family, he tried to put a sword on his bedside (it is said that he was simply a threat and he was ⁇  when he saw the sword when he was sleeping).
On the other hand, there is an anecdote that when he was about to sleep after his coming of age, he met with his wife and two mistresses to become 'Y' for the purpose of assassination.
The photograph of Yoshinobu is said to be a photograph of Yoshinobu, but it is not considered that the photograph was made in Japan at the time of Yoshinobu's young age, so it is not clear whether Yoshinobu himself was himself.
It is said that he often visited Iemochi when he fell ill.
He was known for his ⁇ , and ⁇  AJIMA, his biological father-in-law, praised Yoshinobu as 'Kiyotada TOKUGAWA, who cleaned the Tokugawa lineage' and assumed the position of shogun with the hope of restoring the Tokugawa shogunate, and praised him as ' ⁇  Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.'
Yoshinobu's ⁇  went to the group of overthrowing the Shogunate, and especially Takayoshi KIDO of the Choshu Domain said, 'It is impossible to ⁇  Yoshinobu ⁇ 's ⁇ .
He seemed to have been watching Ieyasu again.'
For the decision of Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor), Ryoma SAKAMOTO said, 'Okiko (Shogun)'s loyalty to the Emperor, and today's suicide is ⁇ .
Even if you don't follow, you will be able to ⁇  even if you don't accept it.
He gave an evaluation of his life for the public' to Yoshinobu, and tried to give him the position of vice chief adviser to the new government.
However, it was in the Meiji period when Yoshinobu knew that Ryoma was Ryoma's presence (after Ryoma's death).
There are no stories about Yoshinobu, and it is very interesting that Ryoma died while he was alive after the Meiji Restoration.
When he was defeated in Osaka Natsu no Jin ( ⁇  Siege of Osaka) and fled to Edo, he was greatly criticized by his enemy's side.
At this time, although the use of kinogi ( ⁇  fans) had been handed down since the time of Ieyasu, there were some who did not forget about the ⁇  of Yoshinobu, and there were some who ⁇  the ⁇  of Yoshinobu's ⁇ .
However, there is an opinion that they needed to resist armed uprisings in Edo and Musashi Province at that time, and because Yoshinobu became the Emperor's enemy, they ⁇  from Osaka-jo Castle, and the long-term battle was necessary to prevent the intervention of foreign countries.
It is said that he was highly regarded as an enemy of the new government or because he was confined to Kanei-ji Temple, or due to the fact that he was confined to Kanei-ji Temple (it is thought that he was influenced by Mitogaku (the scholarship and academic traditions that arose in the Mito Domain) and his mother was from the Imperial Family), but on the other hand, he did not respond to the fact that he was ⁇  to the enemy as his lord.
Due to the fact that he was forced to change his government in a state close to the bloodless revolution, the surrender of Edo Munich and the surrender of Edo Castle, he was highly evaluated for his achievement in the Meiji Restoration.
 ⁇  ⁇ , a businessman, was employed as a retainer when he was the head of the Hitotsubashi-Tokugawa family, and after the Meiji Restoration, he was assassinated.
In his later years, in order to compile a biography of Yoshinobu, ⁇ sawa opened ' ⁇ mue' ( ⁇  Dream) to listen to Yoshinobu's ⁇ .
"Konjaku Monogatari Shu" (The Tale of Times Now Past) is a collection of anecdotes.
In the chapter which is recorded in some zadan-kai (a group of talks between the court and the shogunate), it can be seen that the voice of Yoshinobu in the wedding ceremony can be seen.
It can be said that his character and heart of the time were as follows: 'I don't like you,' 'I don't like you,' 'I don't like you,' 'I don't like you,' 'I don't like you,' and 'I am a ⁇  person.'
Based on these materials, " ⁇  Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA Koki" was completed after Yoshinobu's death.
When he was pardoned as the Emperor's enemy, Yoshinobu expressed his will to express his gratitude to the Emperor Meiji, who was given the highest rank of the peerage, to express his gratitude for his funeral, instead of a Buddhist ceremony.
Therefore, in the graveyard of the Tokugawa family, which was the family temple of the Tokugawa family, there was no grave in the graveyard of the Tokugawa family in Kanei-ji Temple, and a similar round ⁇  was built in Taninaka Reien.
This was due to the ⁇  of the imperial mausoleum of Emperor Komei (according to "Koyo ⁇  Koki" (Diary of Yoshinobu ⁇ )).
Katsukiyo ⁇ , roju (member of shogun's council of elders) and roju (member of shogun's council of elders) at that time, expressed his regret for Yoshinobu's life without worrying about his life after his pardon.
There was a negative image in the ' ⁇  of the enemy' in "Koyo ⁇ " (record of the military exploits of the Takeda family), but after Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor) (transfer of power back to the Emperor), it has been ⁇  in recent years, and there is a movement to revaluate Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA (NHK Historical Drama).
Like his father Nariaki, he was fond of pork in Satsuma Domain, and was called ⁇  Ichisama ( ⁇ -sama, pork and pork were fond of ⁇ -sama).
In his later years, he was interested in Western literary works, and he seemed to have learned ⁇  from ⁇  NISHI (illuminator) during the age of the shogun when he was involved in photographing, fishing, microorganisms, microorganisms, microorganisms, and tegeis (embroidery).
He is famous as a ⁇ man, but it seems that his technique of shooting was not advanced.
He often contributed to the magazine, but it is said that he did not allow it to be adopted.
His great-grandson, ⁇  TOKUGAWA, was also a freeman, and his photograph taken by Yoshinobu was found in the house of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA and edited and edited it.
His younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA was a friend of his ⁇ .
On December 3, 1855, he changed his name to ⁇  ICHIJO (he changed his name to Masako ⁇  after the Meiji Restoration).
She and Biga were born on July 16, 1858, but she died young on July 20, 1858.
Since then, he had no children with ⁇ , and in the Meiji period, his tenth son, 11 daughters, who were born between two concubines, were all born.
The couple included the seventh son, Ieyoshi, who succeeded the Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA family, the tenth son, and the tenth son, ⁇ , who became the adopted son-in-law of Kaishu KATSU, and the ninth daughter, Tsuneko, who became the wife of Fushiminomiya Hiroyasu.

▁Note
Nara Line is a railway ( ⁇ ) operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West) from Kizu Station (Kyoto Prefecture) in Kizugawa City, Kyoto Prefecture to Kyoto Station on the Uji Line of the West Japan Railway Company (JR West).
The entire line is included in the suburbs surrounding Kitaoji-dori Street.
Because this station has a direct connection with the Kansai Main Line, its official starting point is Kizu Station, but the trains running from Kyoto to Kizu Station arrive at and depart from Kyoto Station (the number of trains is odd), and the inbound train makes up the inbound train (the number of trains is odd).
Except for the detailed data, it will be described in the direction of Kizu from Kyoto to Kizu.
Its selection is green tea, and the reason why the selection is said to be 'a ⁇  image of the old capital connecting two ancient capitals.'
The jurisdiction ( ⁇  type): West Japan Railway Company ( ⁇  operator)
Route distance (operation kilometers): 34.7▁km
Track gauge: ⁇ ▁mm
Number of stations: 19 (including the starting and terminal stations)
 ⁇ -track section: Shinden - Uji section, JR ⁇  - Kyoto▁section
 ⁇ ed section: entire line (DC 1500V)
 ⁇  ( ⁇ ) system: A ⁇  block system (track section) and a single track automatic block system (track section)
 ⁇  device: A ⁇  Train Stop▁system
Operation center: Shin-Osaka General Control▁Center
M ⁇  speed: ⁇  km/h, ⁇  km/h (track section)
Except for Kizu Station, this station is under the jurisdiction of the Kyoto Branch of West Japan Railway Company (Kizu Station is managed by the Osaka Branch Office of West Japan Railway Company).
As the name of the line, the line between Kyoto and Kizu is named Nara Line, but the entire line is located in Kyoto Prefecture, and there is no route in Nara Prefecture.
This was due to the process of separating the section from Kizu to Nagoya as a part of the Osaka - Nagoya route after the Kansai Railway was merged into Kansai Railway Company, but the section between Osaka and Nagoya was separated as a part of the Kansai Railway Company.
However, trains run from Kizu Station to Nara Station on the Kansai Main Line (Yamatoji Line) and arrive at Nara Station in Nara Prefecture.
JR West established the nickname of the line (JR Kyoto Line, JR Kobe Line and so on) in accordance with the revision of March 13, 1988, but the Nara Line was ⁇ .
Since Kintetsu Nara Line is located in Kintetsu Nara Line, it is sometimes referred to as 'JR Nara Line.'
During the era of Japan National Railways, it was referred to as ' ⁇  Nara Line of Japan National Railways,' and the English letter 'JNR' was also added to the announcement board.
Kintetsu Nara Line is related to the Yamatoji Line between Nanba Station and Nara Station, and the Kintetsu Nara Line is on the Kintetsu Kyoto Line, which is operated by the JR Nara Line.
While many trains on the Kintetsu Kyoto Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line had been operated in parallel before the electrification of the Nara Line until 1984 at the end of the JNR era, trains on the Nara Line were not electrified and even after the electrification of Japan National Railways, two-car trains and two-car trains ran on the JNR/JR ⁇  Line.
However, since JR West was established and incorporated into the Urban Network after the inauguration of JR West, trains were upgraded to four-car trains (some of them were six-car trains), a double-track section became a double-track section and a double-track section became a double-track section, and rapid trains such as rapid trains such as the ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' ( ⁇ ji Rapid Service) were improved.
Today, the characteristics of commuters and students from the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, such as tourist attractions to Byodo-in Temple in Uji City along the line, and commuters from the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, such as Kawaramachi-dori Street.
However, it is largely divided in the east-west direction from Momoyama to Shinden, and in the south of Joyo City, the Kintetsu Kyoto Line, which runs from the center of the town to the center of the town, is located in parallel with the section of the Kintetsu Kyoto Line, which runs parallel to the urban area.
The rolling stock of the Nara Train Depot, a branch office of the Osaka Branch, is used, but the station facilities are managed by the Kyoto branch office except for Kizu Station.
J- ⁇  cards, Suica of East Japan Railway Company (JR East), ⁇  of Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) and PiTaPa of KANSAI  ⁇  ⁇  can be used at all stations.
In the south of Joyo Station, a simple ticket gate is provided for convenience.
Since the 'Kuroshio (train)' running between Kyoto Station and Wakayama Station via the Nara Line, Sakurai Line and Wakayama Line was abolished in 1984, local trains had been operated until 1991 (as a limited express train was temporarily operated for a while), local trains, rapid trains, local trains, local trains, local trains, local trains, local trains, local trains, and local trains are sometimes operated.
This is the highest type of train operated on the Nara Line, and it is operated mainly in the daytime.
Basically, local trains and local trains are operated between local trains and local trains at intervals of 30 minutes.
The nickname ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' was chosen by the general public before the timetable was revised.
As trains connecting Kyoto and Nara, which are sightseeing spots, many tourists use not only Japanese but also foreign tourists.
The rolling stock of the JR (West) ⁇  Train Series 221 is operated by four-car trains or six-car trains.
Rapid trains run at ⁇  km/h on the Sanyo Shinkansen line, and at ⁇  km/h on the Sanyo Shinkansen line, the maximum speed is ⁇  km/h.
The standard time is approximately 44 minutes from Kyoto Station to Nara Station, and approximately 47 minutes from Nara Station.
Because two trains depart from Kamikoma Station or Tanakura Station on the way to Kyoto and arrive at the Miyakoji Rapid Service on the Nara route, there is a slight difference between the inbound and outbound trains and outbound trains.
During the New Year's holidays, the train stopped at Inari Station for the purpose of visiting the shrine on New Year's Day.
▁History
March 3, 2001: The operation started.
March 15, 2003: With the timetable revision, trains began to stop at Tofuku-ji Station and Tamamizu Station.
It is operated during the rush hour during the rush hour.
This stop also stops at JR Ogura Station and Shinden Station (Kyoto Prefecture) where the ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' runs.
The JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series ⁇  was operated with four-car trains or six-car trains.
Basically, local trains and local trains are operated between local trains and local trains at intervals of 30 minutes.
Like the Miyakoji Rapid Service mentioned above, there is a stop at Narayama Station where rapid trains on the Yamatoji Line stop.
Until March 2001, ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' was introduced, and JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series ⁇  was used in Kyoto, Uji, Joyo ( ⁇  at first) and Nara, and JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series 113 was used in the Nara Line, but after that, JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series ⁇  wasn't used.
As a result of the operation, there is a direct train connecting the Yamatoji Line and the Yamatoji Line.
It is operated mainly in the morning and at night.
Initially, it was operated only on weekdays but was also operated on ⁇  and holidays from March 18, 2006 to March 18,▁2006.
Although the trains between Uji Station and Uji Station used to run on the Uji Line at the end of the night, in the past there was a plan to drive local trains from Kizu Station to Kizu Station, but at present the local trains running in front of Shijo-Omiya Station were changed to the terminal station.
One of the trains that start from Kyoto Station on ⁇  and holidays are operated by JR (West) ⁇  Train Series ⁇ , all of which are operated by JR (West) ⁇  Train Series ⁇ .
There is a direct train from the Yamatoji Line to the Yamatoji Line in order to operate trains on the Osaka Loop Line.
The trains on the Nara Line used the color of the same color as ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' and ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' on the Yamatoji Line, but due to the revision of the timetable revision made in March 2008, the color of the trains on the Osaka Loop Line ceased to be used with green letters.
It is described in Shijimon ( ⁇  characters) on the front of Kamikoma Station.
It runs between Kyoto Station, Uji Station, Joyo Station and Kameoka Station.
During the daytime, there was a 15-minute interval between Kyoto Station and Joyo Station, but it became 30-minute intervals between Joyo Station and Kizu Station.
Basically, the cars of the 103 series are operated by the 103 series, but some of them are operated by the ⁇  series.
Some trains run directly to the Yamatoji Line in the early morning and late in the morning and late at night.
In the past, there were sections of the Sakurai Line and the Sakurai Line, but on September 4, 1994, the Nara Line and Sakurai Line were divided into two lines.
Although it is unmanned, trains on the Nara Line sometimes run on the Nara Line.
From 1987 to 1988, the nickname 'Kuroshio (train)' and 'Kuroshio (train)' were introduced to the Kansai Main Line, the Hanwa Good Train Series 381, between Kyoto Station and Shirahama Station, using the nickname 'Kuroshio (train)' from 1988 to 1989.
On January 6, 1998, the Kinki version of the timetable revision made on January 6, 1998, announced that the limited express train would be operated on the Nara Line (as a regular train on the Nara Line), but the plan was later cancelled.
There was a time when the Miyakoji Rapid Service was operated between Kyoto Station and Sakurai Station (between Kyoto Station and Nara Station for Miyakoji Rapid Service), but currently there is no operation on the Sakurai Line including special rapid trains.
During mid-August, the Uji-gawa River Flower Festival, which is the nearest destination to the Uji-gawa River, is operated every special schedule until the end of the 16th timetable, because it's impossible to secure transportation capacity, all of the local trains have been operated at intervals of approximately 10 minutes between Kyoto Station and Uji Station since the 16th century.
Some local trains arrive at and depart from Kizu Station.
The timetable of March 3 at that time was a special schedule for a single single track, and Rapid trains were operated between Kyoto Station and Uji Station, as well as the frequency of operation between Uji Station and Uji Station.
Depending on the year, some trains began making stops at Momoyama Station.
Around 1992, special rapid service was extended to Sakurai Line, mainly on ⁇  and holidays, and one hour was operated between Tenri Station and Tenri Station.
In addition, the trains that are exclusively operated exclusively for groups throughout Japan are sometimes sometimes operated.
In particular, when the Tenrikyo ⁇ tai on October 26 every year, trains that are operated directly from Kyoto Station to Tenri Station via the Nara Line, the Nara Line, the Yamatoji Line, the Yamatoji Line, the Yamatoji Line, the Nara Line, and the Sakurai Line.
All of them belong to Nara Train Depot.
JR (West) ⁇  Train Series<unk>
There are two types of cars, four-car trains and six-car trains as well as the Yamatoji Line and the Osaka Loop Line.
Although four-car trains are mainly used for ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' and ' ⁇  Rapid Service' or six-car trains, four-car trains are mainly used on the Nara Line.
Two-car trains and two-car trains can be seen on holidays.
JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series▁103
Rapid trains of the 103 series, which are used for local trains on the Nara Line, are operated not only on the Nara Line but on the Nara Line, but also on the Osaka Loop Line and the Yamatoji Line during rush hour.
Some of the cars are transferred from the Morinomiya Train Depot to the cars transferred from the Morinomiya Train Depot.

Keiji Bypass (Keiji Bypass, Anglo-PSSSSSSSSS) is a general Bypass that extends from Kusatsu City, Shiga Prefecture to Kumiyama Town, Kuse County, Kyoto Prefecture.
It is designated as a plan for local high- ⁇  highways.
The Keiji Bypass on the Keiji Bypass of Yuryo Road first ⁇ s the Keiji Bypass of the National Highway Route No. 1, followed by the Keiji Bypass of the National Highway Route No. 24.
It is connected with Meishin Expressway, and connects with Meishin Expressway in Otsu City and Kyoto City, and connects to ⁇  Interchange of Meishin Expressway, Nagoya City, and ⁇  Interchange and Osaka City.
According to the law, the Setahigashi Interchange, the Kumiyama-higashi Interchange, the National Highway Route No. 1 and the Kumiyama-Yodo Interchange (Keiji Bypass), the Kumiyama-Yodo Interchange, which is designated as National Highway Route No. 478 by National Highway Route No. ⁇ , is the high-temperature high- ⁇  highway (Kyoto ⁇  Expressway) based on National Highway Route No. ⁇ , and the Kumiyama-cho Interchange, which is designated by the Minister of Land, ⁇ , Transport and Tourism, is a national highway bus.
In the future plan, due to the need for the construction of a road connecting Kyoto Tanba Road and Keiji Bypass, which were the National Highway 9 Bypass, to connect the Kyoto- ⁇  Road and Keiji Bypass, which had a function of ⁇  the Meishin Expressway and ⁇ -track section of Kyoto-Yodo Route.
The Kyoto L ⁇  Expressway and the Kyoto Second Outer R ⁇  Expressway have been designated as National Highway Route No. ⁇ , and the maintenance of the road has been maintained.
According to the indication of the route, Keiji Bypass is introduced in the direction of Seta Higashi-Maizuru Station and Keiji Bypass at Oyamazaki Station.
There are no differences between the Meishin Expressway and the Keiji Bypass via either routes or the ETC discount system.
If no special mention is made, Keiji Bypass (from Setahigashi Interchange to Oyamazaki Station) is used as the name of a business operator.

The Uji Tunnel of this route, which has a long National Route 113 and 313 meters, is prohibited except for the buses of Uji Higashi Interchange and Kasatori Interchange in the tunnel, except for 500 meters in front of the Kasatori Interchange.
Prior to the opening of the Kumiyama ⁇ , the film "THEVICE II Standing Statue" was shot in the movie before the opening.
Seta Higashi IC - the distance of the Oyamazaki IC and the Hirakata Bypass is shorter than that of the Meishin Expressway, and if you pass through the Keiji Bypass, you will go to the destination earlier than the Keiji Bypass.
Because there are no ⁇  facilities such as services in the service area, there are many cases where the Meishin Expressway is more expensive than the Meishin Expressway (there are two ⁇ s in the Otsu Service Area and the Katsuragawa ⁇  Area).
However, due to the fact that both sides of the Seta Higashi and Oyamazaki stations were built after the god's name (especially the structure of the Oyamazaki Cable Cars), they were forced to reduce the speeds in the LD ( ⁇  Expressway) section.
There is an opinion that if you go from Oyamazaki Station to ⁇  Station or arrive at the left side of Meishin Expressway, you may join the Meishin Expressway.
Also, there are many ⁇ s and slopes on the way, so it's impossible to function as a ⁇  for Meishin Expressway because there are many ⁇ s connecting them.
This road is a ⁇  for motor vehicles because it is a ⁇  of National Highway Route No. 1 (National Highway) and is not a high-speed drive route.
If you go from the east side of the Uji-gawa River to the Keiji Bypass of ⁇  and Kumiyama-cho, you must go to the west of Uji-nishi Interchange.
This is because the Ujihigashi Interchange is a ⁇ .
Therefore, in the daytime there are many general roads between the Ujihigashi Interchange and the Ujinishi Interchange.
Because this general road section isn't under ⁇  with VIVISS, it is difficult to avoid ⁇ .

Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is a god (Shinto) appearing in Japanese Mythology.
In the "Engishiki" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), 'Amateru' is referred to as 'Amateru.'
It is a godification of the sun and is considered to be one of the ancestors of the Imperial Family (Kososhin).
In "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), it is described as Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) or in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan).
It is also known as ⁇  no ⁇  no Kami.
While several gods are described in the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), in the "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), they are unified under the name of 'Tenshodai okami' in the "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters).
Although she is a goddess, there is another theory that she was actually a male god.
As the name Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is used in political parts such as "Kotai Jingu ⁇ cho" ( ⁇  of the Ceremonies for Kotai-jingu Shrine) and so on, there is a theory that ⁇  was originally the ancestral deity of the Three Shrines in the Imperial Court (Komusubi no mikoto) and Nishi ⁇  no mikoto was the ancestor of the Imperial Family and became Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
In Ise-jingu Shrine, it is usually called Amatsumara okami or Sume oomikami, and it is also called Amatsu kami okami no kami when chanting a name before a Shinto ritual.
Today, 'Takama' and 'Katakana' are extant in academic documents.
There is also a theory that it was written as 天 ⁇ 神 in ancient times.
Descriptions in▁mythology
According to "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), when Izanagi returned from the ⁇  (world after death) where Izanami was living and washed ⁇ , he was born when he washed his left eye when he washed ⁇ .
At this time, she was called ⁇  no Mikoto, along with her right eye and nose, and she was called ⁇  no Mikoto.
At that time, Izanagi ordered Amaterasu Omikami to ⁇  Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).
Susanoo, who was entrusted with the sea, was exiled by Izanagi due to his ⁇  that he wanted to go to the land of Izanami.
Susanoo met his older sister Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) before the conquest of Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains), but Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) thought that his younger brother, Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess), came to Takamanohara (plain of high heaven), and was given an armed force.
In order to ⁇  Susano's ⁇ , five male gods were born from the real world of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and three goddesses were born from Susano's real fruit, and Susano won the victory.
Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) was born from the real world of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess), and Amaterasu Omikami was regarded as the child of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
Amenooshihomimimi
Amenohohi
Amatsuhikone
Irihikone
Kumanokusubi
Susanoo, who was ⁇  by this, worked hard in Takamanohara (plain of high heaven), and as a result, Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) hid herself in Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains).
 ⁇  became apparent, and various misfortunes occurred.
Yaoyorozu no Mikoto, the god of Chichibu in Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains), and Ame no M ⁇  no Mikoto, the god of heaven, were succeeded by Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess), and Susano was exiled from Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).
Ame no M ⁇  no Mikoto sent his son, Amenooshihomi to ⁇  Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains).
After the conquest of Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains), ⁇  no ⁇  (the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess) decided to ⁇  Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains), but Ninigi (the Sun Goddess) gave birth to Ninigi (the grandson of the sun goddess), Ninigi's grandson Ninigi (the grandson of the sun goddess).
The▁interpretation
In the mythology, there is a view that Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) worshiped the gods by performing religious services in accordance with the instructions of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) (the Sun Goddess) who was born earlier than ⁇  (the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess) or Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) in accordance with the instructions.
There is also an opinion that it is a ⁇  of ancient shrine maiden.
Another name 'Hirume' is 'Hime no Onna' and it refers to a shrine maiden serving the sun god.
Although the sun god is originally a male god, there is a theory that a shrine maiden serving it was identified with the sun god and became a goddess.
There is also a theory that it was because this goddess was established during the reign of Empress Jito, or that Himiko was a model for Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
It is pointed out that the birth of 'moku' of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and Tsukuyomi no kami (the Sun Goddess) in the sun and Tsukuyomi no kami (the sun god of the moon) is described in "Reiho Gofu" (a preface written before the sixth century) (from the beginning of the seventh century) in "Reiho Gofu" (a preface to the end of the seventh century) (from the beginning of the seventh century), and in "Keiho ⁇ kyo" ( ⁇  to the end of the seventh century), there is a strong influence on Dokyo.
Also, it is said that the concept of ⁇ -jingu Shrine, such as Ise-jingu Shrine where Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess), Ise-jingu Shrine, Ise-jingu Shrine, Saigu-no-miya Shrine, ⁇ -no-Miya, ⁇ -no-Miya, ⁇ -no- ⁇ , ⁇ -no- ⁇ , ⁇ -no- ⁇ , ⁇ -no- ⁇ , ⁇ -no-Miya, ⁇ -jinja Shrine, ⁇ -jinja Shrine, and so on, corresponds to the concept of Kotai-jingu Shrine.
Based on the comparison of the mythological mythology, it is pointed out that the myth of the birth of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is almost the same as the Banko myth in ancient times (the third to fourth century).
In addition, there is a theory that it was a mythical myth introduced to Japan along with ethnic groups in the period of the preceding history because the sun rises in Asia spread throughout Asia.
According to one theory, in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), ⁇  transformed into three stages.
The following is a summary of the events and contents.
 ⁇ : The Taika Reforms were revised.
Before this, the Imperial Family did not follow Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
Hinokami' (the sun god) itself is called 'Hinokami' (the sun god).
The male god who was called 'Ateruteru' is widely known.
In "Engishiki" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), there are shrines with the pronunciation of 'Amateru-jinja Shrine' in Tsushima as well as 'Amateru-jinja Shrine' in Tanba, 'Amateru-jinja Shrine' in Harima.
Incidentally, Amenomateru is another name for Amenohoakari, a grandson of Amaterasu, and Amenohoakari is the earliest ancestor of the Owari clan, Tsumori clan and Kaibe clan.
Also, ⁇ 's younger brother was Ninigi, who was the grandson of ⁇ , and was the grandson of Emperor Jinmu.
672: Jinshin▁War
It is also called 'Ohirume no michi' (literally, 'a woman who worships the sun god') or 'a woman who worships the sun god'.
In this case, there are two interpretations: one is that the enshrined deity is Ohiru, and the other is that it is 'Ateru' of the male god of snake.
 ⁇ : The Kotai-jingu Shrine was built.
She is 'the ancestor of Amaterasu' and 'the ancestor of the Imperial Family.'
She is a goddess.
Based on the model of Empress Jito, she was created as a humanized god by nature.
After that, 'Tenteru' other than the Kososhin was called 'Amateruteru.'
For example, in "Shinsen ⁇ " (Newly ⁇  Register of Clan Names and Titles of ⁇ ) (around 1060), the part of 'Amateru' is read as 'Amateru no Kami' and the part of 'Amateruhiko no Mikoto' in "Sendai ⁇ " (Ancient Japanese History).
1880-1881: Controversy in Shinto circles over the enshrined deity of the Shinto ⁇  Shrine, which was established in ⁇ , Tokyo.
Shinto ⁇  insisted that 'Izumo school' should be united with 'Yugen ichinyo' and 'Yugen no kami' as the enshrined deities enshrined in the sanctuary of the ⁇  (the Bureau of Shinto Shrines) and Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) (the Sun Goddess) as well as ' ⁇  no kami' (the God of the Land of Reed Plains) as ' ⁇  no kami' (the God of Reed Plains) and ' ⁇  no kami' (the God of ⁇ ).
However, 'Ise-ha' (Ise school) which was the center of Shinto ⁇  (Shinto ⁇ ) was 'Tenchi Dai ⁇ ' (Great ⁇  of Heaven and Earth) in which Amaterasu Omikami ruled the two worlds, and other gods opposed ⁇ .
In the end, there were various theories, such as 'The Izumo school has a grudge against the ⁇  of the ⁇  years since the age of the gods,' 'It is said that the Izumo school should kill Senke Sonfuku, who had been ⁇  in the Imperial Family,' and so on.
Before long, this dispute was settled by Emperor Meiji's decision (the Izumo faction was defeated) and Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) was given the highest rank.
It is said that the government recognized the possibility of the creation of the creed system common in Shinto and that it was impossible to control the common people directly by the Fukko Shinto theory.
See the dispute on the enshrined deity of ⁇  Shinto Shrine.
 ⁇  ⁇  used another name 'Ohiruchimuchi' when he appeared in his novel to ⁇  Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
This is due to the fact that the term ' ⁇  Omikami' (the Sun Goddess) comes from the fact that the ancestor gods appear in the text, the sun god and the sun god appear in the form of nature, and the sun god is also called 'the great sun god.'
In fact, in the novel by ⁇  ⁇ , there is a description that he was not able to judge the ⁇ , the Battle of Nagashino, the Battle of Nagashino, and the Battle of Nagashino.
Masaatsu YASUOKA (1898 - 1983), who established Konkei Gakuin School, said 'There is a belief in Amaterasu Omikami in Japan.
Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is the ideal of ⁇ ing the world by the spirit of Japan.
The word 'iza' in Izanami and Izanagi says, 'iza' is the ideal of the world's ⁇ , the pioneers of the world, and the pioneers of the world.'
Shrines that enshrine Amaterasu▁Omikami
The shrines that enshrine Amaterasu Omikami are called ⁇ -jinja Shrines all over the country, but the main shrine is Naiku (inner shrine) of Ise-jingu Shrine ( ⁇ -jingu Shrine).
Kotai-daijingu Shrine is a shrine that enshrines Yata no Kagami (the eight imperial treasures) as one of the Three Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family.
Most of the shrines throughout Japan enshrine the Shinsatsu (Daijingu taima) of Kotai-jingu Shrine (Amateru-Daijingu Shrine).
Daimyo (Japanese territorial lord) is a term that refers to the lord of a daimyo (Japanese feudal lord).
It also refers to a person who has a great name.
The term "tsuitoshi" refers to a small person.
The word "mono" originally referred to those who extended their power in the provinces.
Among them, in the samurai society, it became the word meaning a samurai who owned many territories and subordinates.
In the Muromachi period, shugo (provincial constables) strengthened their control over their territory and became shugo daimyo (shugo, which were Japanese provincial military governors, that became daimyo, which were Japanese feudal lords).
During the Sengoku period (period of warring states), a large feudal lord who established chigyo-chi (territory) appeared and was called Kokujin (local samurai) or Sengoku daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period).
During the Edo period, the chigyo-chi (territory) of more than 10,000 koku (approximately 1.8 million liters of crop yield) was given to the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) by the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
Among samurai with a stipend of less than 10,000 koku, samurai under the direct control of the bakufu were called jikisan.
Since feudal lords share the character of feudal lords in common with lords in China, they were treated as daimyo (Japanese feudal lords) by ⁇ ing feudal lords.
This section describes the details of the early-modern daimyo in the Edo period.
Refer to the section on shugo daimyo (shugo, which were Japanese provincial military governors, that became daimyo, which were Japanese provincial military governors, that became daimyo, which were Japanese feudal lords) and Sengoku daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period).
 ⁇ -ji▁Temple
Karoku (hereditary stipend) during the Edo period was determined according to the social standing, official rank, kokudaka (crop yield), yakuryo ( ⁇  of crop yield), and yakuseki ( ⁇  rank).
Firstly, due to the relationship with the Tokugawa Shogun family, it was classified into the Oie family (Shinpan, Shinpan daimyo), Fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) who were vassals of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara, Fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family), and Fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) who were mainly vassals of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara.
The first shogun, Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, ordered the Owari Tokugawa family, the Owari Tokugawa family, and the Owari Tokugawa family to keep the existence of the Shogun family, and the Mito Tokugawa family, who were allowed to keep the Tokugawa family's control over the entire country, to assist daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) throughout the country, to grant the Tokugawa ⁇  (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family) as well as to assist the Shogun family, and ⁇  TOKUGAWA, the ninth son of the Tokugawa family, to the Owari Domain, to the Mito Domain and Mito Domain.
In addition, Ieyasu appointed Hideyasu YUKI, the second son of the second Shogun Hidetada TOKUGAWA, to the Echizen Domain, as well as daimyo (feudal lord) of the Tokugawa family all over the country.
In addition, he placed fudai daimyo (hereditary vassals to the Tokugawa family) as fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) of the Tokugawa Shogun family for successive generations as fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) and in charge of military force of the bakufu, he was appointed to important posts, including Tairo (chief minister) roju (member of shogun's council of elders) of the bakufu (member of shogun's council of elders), and assisted the shogunate government.
The fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) were relatively low, and the fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family), such as the Torii clan, the ⁇ bara clan, the Honda clan, the Honda clan, and the Ogasawara clan, were relatively large, but in the Edo period, fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family), fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) with more than 100,000 koku, including the Sakai clan, the Abe clan, the ⁇  clan, the ⁇  clan, the ⁇  clan, the ⁇  clan, the ⁇  clan, the ⁇  clan, the ⁇  clan, and the Toda clan.
This became the reason for separation of power and military power.
 ⁇  daimyo (nonhereditary feudal lords) were subordinate daimyo after the Battle of Sekigahara, and many of them were opposed to the Tokugawa family in the Battle of Sekigahara.
For this reason, the ⁇  of the bakufu was strong and actively engaged in ⁇  activities, and if there were fears of ⁇  or rebellions, they were strictly punished.
Among the major tozama daimyo, there were many tozama daimyo (nonhereditary feudal lords) such as the Kaga Domain, the Satsuma Domain, the Satsuma Domain, the Sendai Domain, the Sendai Domain, the Sendai Domain, the Sendai Domain, the Kira clan, the Mori clan, the Uesugi clan, the Uesugi clan, the Yonezawa Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Tosa Yamauchi clan, and the Satake clan, and the Akita Domain.
In addition, the status of daimyo was divided according to the status of "daimyo" (feudal lord) or "daimyo" (lord of a castle) whose territory was more than one province or more, "joshu daimyo" (lord of a castle) who had a castle, "joshu" (lord of a castle) or "daimyo" (lord of a castle) with a castle without a castle, and " ⁇ " (regional government office) which daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) stayed in Edo-jo Castle.
For details, refer to the section on ⁇ seki.
Based on the level of daimyo (Japanese territorial lord), daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) with 100,000 koku (a unit of volume: rice 1-koku is 180.39 liter; a unit of volume: rice 1-koku is 180.39 liter, lumber 1-koku is 180.39 liter, lumber 1-koku is 0.278 cubic meter) possessed territory as well as neighboring castles.
In the case of dynastic nation-state, one village was divided into another feudal lord and the other feudal lord (called Aikyu).
Daimyo (feudal lord) were more than 10,000 koku in principle, but the Kiregawa Domain of the ⁇  clan of the ⁇  clan was 5,000 koku.
This is because the ⁇  clan was descended from the Ashikaga clan.
Daimyo were controlled by the bakufu by the system of ⁇  (a system under which feudal lords were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo) and ⁇  (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo).
In addition, because he was ordered to protect the coastal areas during the end of Edo period or in the end of the Edo period, the daimyo were always in financial difficulties.
