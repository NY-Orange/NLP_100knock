Umekoji Steam ⁇  Museum is an exhibition facility for steam locomotives managed by West Japan Railway Company (JR West) in Kankiji-cho, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.
On October 10, 1972, it was opened to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Japan's opening of Japan National Railways ( ⁇ ) to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Japan's opening of Japan National Railways, and it was the first facility to preserve steam locomotives as precious cultural properties and preserve them.
JR West succeeded to JR West due to the division and privatization of JNR in 1987.
This facility itself is an active car base (Umekoji ⁇  Operation Center) and has been ⁇ ed and tested by JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series ⁇  and diesel locomotives owned by the Sagano Scenic Railway.
In the first place, the development of steam locomotives rapidly disappeared from the latter half of the 1960s.
At first, because it was close to Kashihara City, Tochigi Prefecture, it was the most likely candidate for the ⁇ -ku Ward, which was located in Oyama Station, Tochigi Prefecture, but when it was located in 'the central part of Japan', it was decided that Umekoji-ku Ward (the present-day Umekoji-ku Ward) was located in 'the central area of Japan,' and it was officially selected as a preservation district for the preservation district.
Although it was decided that the existing cars should be selected as the oldest existing cars ( ⁇  1) in principle, there were some cars that were not supposed to be preserved at first, such as C6262 model No.2.
The facility consists of the "SL Exhibition Hall" which uses a fan-shaped structure of the former Umekoji-ku Ward, and the " ⁇  Exhibition Hall," which was reconstructed and restored by the former Nijo Station house.
A Sensu-type ⁇  was made of reinforced concrete built in 1914, and it was designated as a national important cultural property along with five-toned ⁇  ceilings (completed in 1915) and pullerails on December 10, 2004.
In 2004, it was selected as a civil engineering worker for civil engineering selection of civil engineering.
In 2006, the old Nijo Station building ( ⁇  Exhibition Hall), the Ogi-type train-car train-car train-cars, the one-car train-car train-car train-cars, the one-car train-cars, and the repairs were designated as the semi- ⁇  railway- ⁇  railway.
The former Nijo station building was built in 1904 by the oldest two-storey Japanese-style Japanese-style house, which was built by Kyoto Electric Railway as the head office building, and was built in front of Heian-jingu Shrine in consideration of the landscape.
Kyoto Electric Railway was ⁇  in 1907 and subsequently used as a station for the section between Nijo Station ( ⁇  Line) and Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) on the Sanin Main Line ( ⁇  Line) in 1996, completing the role as an elevated station building on the Sanin Main Line ( ⁇  Line) between Nijo Station (Kyoto Prefecture) and Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture) in 1996, and its interior was moved and reconstructed in 1997 to the site of the main building and reconstructed in 1997 to preserve the old buildings.
It was designated as a cultural property by Kyoto City in April 1996.
18 sets of 118 domestic steam locomotives manufactured from the Taisho period to the Showa period (at the beginning of the opening, 116 tanks) were housed and exhibited.
In the early days of the opening of the museum, the C5353-car trains and C51-type C51-type steam locomotives were registered by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare, but after that, seven-car trains, which have been stored for a long time, have been preserved for a long time in 2006 and seven-car trains.
Of the five types of trains, two cars (C57 type, C57 ⁇ ) are still registered on the Tokaido Main Line, and two trains (C57 ⁇ , C56 ⁇ ) are served by ' ⁇  (train)' on the Yamaguchi Line, ' ⁇  (train)' on the Hokuriku Main Line and 'Kita- ⁇  (train)' on the Hokuriku Main Line.
It is impossible to run on the main line because there are no ⁇ s except for these two cars, and no inspections are conducted in general, so it's impossible to run on the main line.
Also, the 'SL team' train-cars, which are stored in the museum, are operated by the rails in the museum.
This display route used to be connected to the northern end of a large parking lot (which once had a large-size parking lot in the building) from the depot to the north of the depot, but the current Umekoji-koen Park was moved to the former station building, and the current Umekoji-koen-Umekoji Station was moved to the south of the station building.
Even today, it has a function as an institution, and is connected with a commercial line.
Furthermore, after the operation of Takatori factory of West Japan Railway Company (JR West) was closed, steam locomotives have been preserved.
Japanese▁plum
It originates from 'Ume' which means Umekoji.
All trains except the C62 model No. 62, which had been designated in 1976, were designated as semi- ⁇  railway by the Ministry of Land, ⁇ , Transport and Tourism in▁2006.
The procedures in which no special mention is made are made in 1972 from the previous organization of the organization.
Umekoji Station has no registered address since the preservation of Umekoji Station.

Shomyo is one of Japanese traditional music.
It is a religious music that is used for rites and festivals.
It is also called Bonbai or Bonnoku in Japan.
In the old ⁇ , it is written as  ⁇  in hiragana (Japanese syllabary characters).
It is one of the academic fields (gomyo or gomyo).
Five subjects of Confucianism refer to five kinds of shomyo (chanting of Buddhist commandments), shomyo (chanting of Letters, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology), myobomyo ( ⁇  of medicine), Inmyo ( ⁇  of medical science), and Naimyo (students of Buddhism).
It was introduced into Japan along with Buddhism.
There is a record that a Buddhist memorial service was held in ⁇  when the Great Buddha of Todai-ji Temple was held, and it is thought that Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) was actively performed in the Nara period.
In the early Heian period, Saicho and Kukai transmitted Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) to form the basis of Tendai Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) and Shingon Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant).
Even in Buddhist sects other than the Tendai sect and Shingon sect, each sect has their own Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) and has been handed down to the present day.
Since Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) passed down in oral teachings, there was no evidence to prove it.
Therefore, ⁇  was extremely difficult.
Later, hakase (master of astronomy) was invented as tenmon hakase (master of astronomy).
Also, technical terms such as hakase vary depending on each school.
However, hakase is a reference in order to recite Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s), and in order to learn Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s), it is necessary to acquire and inherit the teachings from master to disciple, and it is impossible to maintain and inherit the teachings of Buddha from master to disciple.
Therefore, the development of leaders and successors was required.
As a result of various conditions, many schools disappeared.
The Tendai Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) was introduced by Saicho, and developed independently.
After Saicho, Ennin and Annen flourished.
 ⁇ , the founder of ⁇ -ji Temple, is known as the Chuko no So (father of restoration).
In ⁇ , ⁇  built ⁇ -in Temple ( ⁇  Ward, Kyoto City) in Ohara, Kyoto.
The sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple, is Gyozan of ⁇ -in Temple in Ohara, and is modeled after Mt. Gyozan in China.
Later, ⁇ -in Temple and Shoko-in Temple became known as the training hall for Shomyo Nenbutsu (Buddhist liturgical chant) of Ohara-ryu School.
Later, Jakugen formed a group, and in Ohara there was a statement of Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) of the two schools.
Later, ⁇  revived Ohara Shomyo (chanting of Ohara).
Tanchi developed the trend based on the new music theory.
After that, he established the center of Tendai Shomyo (chanting of Tendai Shomyo) and inherited the present Tendai Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant).
Shomyo Nenbutsu, Jodo Shu, Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) and Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) are the lineages of Tendai Shomyo.
Shingon Shomyo (chanting of Shingon Buddhism) originated from Kukai, which led to the foundation of the Shingon Ritsu sect.
It was after the mid-Edo period that Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ ) was ⁇ .
 ⁇  can be said to have been one of the Chuko no So (father of restoration).
He strived to compose and improve Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ ).
There were many schools until the Kamakura period, but four schools were established by Cloistered Imperial Prince Kakusho (Honsoin-ryu, Shinsoin-ryu, Daigo-ryu, Daigo-ryu, and ⁇ -ryu).
The Shomyo of the Kogi Shingon sect declined and disappeared during the Edo period.
Honpoin-ryu, Shinpo-in-ryu, Daigo-ryu and Daigo-ryu were abolished in the early Meiji period.
Currently, it is divided into Chizan Shomyo (Mt. Chizan in Kyoto), Buzan Shomyo (Mt. ⁇ -dera Temple in Nara), Nanzanshin-ryu school (Mt. Koya, Mt. Koya, Koyasan Shingon sect temple in Kyoto) and Kogi Shingon sect.
The Shomyo Nenbutsu (Buddhist liturgical chant) of Chizan Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant), Shingon sect Chizan school and Shingon sect ⁇  school of Shingonshu sect are derived from the Nakagawa Daishin school.
 ⁇  gave shelter to the old school of Daigo.
When Negoro-ji Temple ( ⁇  Prefecture) was burned down by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI in 1583, the Negoro-ji Temple in Mt. Chisan and Mt. Toyoyama were merged into the school based on the old school of Daigo.
 ⁇ istically, it is called 'rongi' or 'shomyo' in Mt. ⁇ .
The Nakagawa Oshin school of the Nanzan Shingi Shingon sect (Kogi Shingon sect Shomyo) became the original school.
Nakagawa Oshin-ryu school was founded by Oishin at Nakagawa-dera Temple in Nara Prefecture.
During the Teiei era (1232 - ⁇ ), Shoshin of Mt. Koya and Sanbo-in Temple moved his base to Mt. Koya.
Later, he changed his name to Mt. Koya, which was another name for Mt. Koya, to Mt. Nanshin-ryu.
He was the founder of the ⁇  school and the Noshin school.
The music of Joruri ( ⁇  narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment), Yokyoku (Noh song), Joruri ( ⁇  narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment), Joruri ( ⁇  narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment), Joruri ( ⁇  narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment) and Joruri ( ⁇  narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment) can be said to have changed the form of Shomyo.
It had a great influence on ⁇  music.

Saimei (August 24, 661) - Shosei system (a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code)
On February 20, ⁇ , Emperor Tenchi ascended the throne.
On January 7, 672, he died at the age of 46.
(There is a theory in " ⁇ " ( ⁇  of court nobles) that says he died of illness, 'There is a theory that he was killed in a mountain where he was killed by the Emperor Tenmu side because he was killed in the mountains of Mt. Sanryo (the mountain where the mausoleum of Emperor Tenmu was located) after the assassination of the Emperor Keiko.)
Emperor Tenchi did not succeed to the throne for a long time, and it is one of the ⁇ s in the political history of the late seventh century.
There are several views on this matter.
In consideration of the Emperor Tenmu's influence.
In other words, it is ⁇  that Emperor Tenmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi, and it is based on the theory that he was a prince of the Han Dynasty who was born before Empress Kogyoku married Emperor Jomei, and that he was a different father of Emperor Tenchi.
In fact, if the year of Emperor Tenmu's death was calculated based on the age of Emperor Tenmu in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) and some history books, the year of Emperor Tenmu was the longest period.
However, there is no contradiction between the same historical materials, and there are many historical materials that stand about the age of eight to nine.
On the other hand, according to the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), the age of Emperor Tenchi, who was sixteen years older than his father, died when he was sixteen years old, appeared in the 'Nihon Shoki' (Chronicles of Japan) because 'if he was a younger brother of his older brother,' although he was a younger brother.
Therefore, "Honcho koin jounroku" (the Emperor's family tree, made in the Muromachi period) and others were adopted in 1414.
According to a counterargument with " ⁇  in ancient times," Emperor Tenchi and Emperor ⁇ , whose reign was not unusual in ancient times (after the reign of Emperor Tenmu, Emperor Tenchi and Empress Jito), also did not have the Shosei system and did not ascend to the throne immediately.
(In fact, there was a slight difference between them.)
There is an opposing argument with "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) and other history books which are said to have been compiled as 'Nihon Shoki' (Chronicles of Japan) have different characteristics, so some say that it is impossible to deal with the same.
(Refer to the section on 'Emperor Tenmu's age')
According to one theory, Prince Karu was expelled from his position because of a coup d' ⁇  by Karu no Miko (Emperor Kotoku).
Recently, it has been pointed out that the relationship between Prince Naka no Oe and Emperor ⁇  was relatively good, and that the basic policy was similar to that of Prince Naka no Oe.
In this way, Naka no Oe no Oji ⁇  Iruka's murder.
In addition, based on the description in the Taika Reforms in Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan), this theory was advocated.
Also, this theory attracts attention because of the reasons for the abdication of Emperor Kogyoku and the reason why the Soga clan other than Iruka was exiled even after the coup d' ⁇ .
There is a theory that the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi was opposed to the female relationship of Emperor Tenchi.
This reflects the ⁇  relationship between the Emperor Kotoku and the Emperor Tenchi, who was described in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), as opposed to his wife's daughter, Imperial Princess ⁇  (Emperor Tenchi's great-great-grandson) in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan).
Although the love and marriage of ⁇  and his sister were allowed to marry each other, the situation at that time was due to the situation of ⁇ 's love at that time, but in the story of Ame no M ⁇  no ⁇  (one of the three Empresses: Great Empress Dowager, Empress Dowager, Empress Dowager, and Empress) written by ⁇  no ⁇ , it was pointed out that they were involved in the relationship with her uncle Karu no okimi (the great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandson of Emperor Kotoku) and ⁇  no okimi (the great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandson of Emperor Kotoku), who had a relationship with her uncle Karu no Miko (Emperor Kotoku).
After the death of Empress Saimei, there was a theory that ⁇  no Himemiko succeeded to the Imperial Throne as the consort of the previous emperor, but some records were ⁇  due to some reasons.
This is a theory advocated in "Manyoshu" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) that advocates a person who is called 'Naka no Mikoto' as 'Naka no Mikoto' in "Manyoshu" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) and that 'Naka no Mikoto' can be interpreted as a successor to Emperor Tenchi until the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi.
If ⁇  no Himemiko is referred to as 'Naka no Mikoto' as 'Naka no Mikoto', there is a view that she was especially called 'Naka no Mikoto'; however, there is no doubt that she was Empress Saimei.
Due to the nature of political history and restrictions on historical materials, it is difficult to prove, but the study of the future study has been progressing, including cooperation with the results.
▁Poems
Four of his poems were selected for "Manyoshu" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) and "Shoku Nihongi" (Chronicle of Japan Continued).
In Ogura Hyakunin Isshu (the Ogura Anthology of One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Poets), the following poems are included in Ogura Hyakunin Isshu (the Ogura Anthology of One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Poets) as the forefather of the Heian dynasty.

His Kamon (family crest) was Sanmitsudomoe.
The Saionji family was founded by FUJIWARA no Michisue, the third son of FUJIWARA no ⁇ .
When he was a great-grandson of Michisue, he was confined in the Imperial Court as a member of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) at the time of the Jokyu War in which MINAMOTO no Yoritomo's niece, MINAMOTO no Yoritomo, was accused of being involved in the Jokyu War, and, after the war, he gained the confidence of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), seized the real power of the Imperial Court as ⁇  (Grand minister of state) and rose to the position of Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).
Saionji's family name was named after ⁇ -ji Temple, which was the second villa in Kyoto ( ⁇ so villa, Kadono County, Yamashiro Province).
This hall was also called Kitayama-dono Palace, and the current Kinkaku-ji Temple was built by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA from the Saionji family.

 ⁇  SAIONJI married Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama), and made his daughter marry the Cloistered Emperor Kameyama and Emperor Godaigo.
However, after the death of his son Kinhira SAIONJI, the Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama) sided with the Jimyoin-to (imperial lineage from Emperor Gofukakusa to Emperor Gokomatsu) and deepened confrontation with the Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama).
Later, during the time of Kinmune SAIONJI, the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) fell and the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) played an important role in the Battle of Oshu.
Kinmune harbored ⁇  HOJO (Tokioki HOJO), the remnants of the Hojo clan, and assassinated Emperor Godaigo, who started the Kenmu Restoration, and plotted to overthrow the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) after the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun); however, Kinmune was arrested and executed due to the betrayal of his younger brother, Kinshige SAIONJI.
During the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, ⁇  SAIONJI, the son of Kinmune, served the Northern Court (Japan) and became Udaijin (Minister of the Right), and restored the family name.
During the Muromachi and Edo periods, it flourished as a family business for biwa (Japanese lute).
During the Muromachi period, ⁇  SAIONJI invited Tadataka HOSOKAWA, the heir of Tadaoki HOSOKAWA (later disinherited), and Kyumu ⁇ , the eldest daughter of Kyumu ⁇ , to the position of ⁇  (Minister of the Sovereign's Household), but Nagaoka was not allowed to be promoted to Sadaijin (Minister of the Left) and given 600 koku (approx. 180 liters/koku) to the Saionji family.
Kinmochi SAIONJI was adopted from Rikken ⁇  (a political party organized by Hirobumi ITO) at the end of the Edo period, and after the Meiji Restoration he played an active role as a politician and played an important role in the politics of the Taisho and Showa periods as a Genro ( ⁇  statesman).
Incidentally, Kinmochi had a bitter experience of playing biwa (Japanese lute) in the Saionji family's family business, but during his term of prime minister, he said to Emperor Meiji, 'I want to listen to biwa (Japanese lute) of the Saionji family from the Saionji family,' and he suffered four hardships from the staff of gagaku (ancient Japanese court dance and music) and the staff of gagaku (ancient Japanese court dance and music) of gagaku (ancient Japanese court dance and music) and biwa (Japanese lute) of biwa (Japanese lute) of the Imperial court).

It is written in  ⁇  style using Manyo-gana (a form of syllabary used in the Manyoshu [Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves]), and it is often written as  ⁇ , but reflecting the ⁇  of the decline of the Nakanokanpaku family and the death of his master Teishi/Sadako, which reflects the ⁇  of the decline of the Nakanokanpaku family.
The sophisticated sensibility of the author and the sharp observation of the "Genji Monogatari" (The Tale of Genji) was combined, and the beauty of the ' ⁇ ' of "Genji Monogatari" (The Tale of Genji) was inspired by the ' ⁇ ' beauty of the ' ⁇ ' world.

According to "Makura no Soshi" (The Pillow Book), since she had a deep affection for both human beings and nature, she received many kinds of aesthetics and created them as the beauty of polyester.
In the next chapter of each chapter, there is no distinction between ⁇ s, ⁇ s, ⁇ s, and ⁇ , which can be seen from the next to the next chapter, and the material is ⁇  by the expression of the weathering of a horse (Kogidani Valley).
The expression of ' ⁇  -  ⁇ ' (e.g.,  ⁇ ) (e.g.,  ⁇ ), which is seen in Manyo-gana (a form of syllabary used in the Manyo-shu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves)) at that time, followed by ' ⁇  -  ⁇  - Asa' which is seen in hiragana (Japanese syllabary characters) in hiragana (Japanese syllabary characters), followed by ' ⁇  - Asa' (Japanese syllabary characters) in hiragana (Japanese syllabary characters) and '朝顔' (Japanese syllabary characters) and '朝顔' ( ⁇ ).
It was the ⁇  of Teishi's ⁇  to Chugu Teishi.
It was written in order to calm the soul of Teishi, who died while the ⁇  of Michitaka's family declined.
Therefore, it is a matter of course that Michitaka's family declined (same as above).
Even in the era when people who took care of chugu (the second consort of an emperor) and chugu (the second consort of an emperor) were disappointed, they insisted that they lived in the world of love and good fortune ( ⁇ ).

Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA was the 15th Seii Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) (his reign was from December 5, 1866 to December 9, 1867).
He was the only shogun who did not carry out his duty as Shogun in Edo-jo Castle.
He was Naidaijin (Minister of the Center) with the rank of Juichii (Junior First Rank) and the First Order of Merit.
He was a member of Kizokuin (the House of Peers).
After the death of the 14th Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA, who acted as Shogun's guardian, he became the 15th Shogun of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
After the Emperor Meiji returned political power (= Taisei Hokan [transfer of power back to the Emperor]), he aimed at kobu- ⁇  ( ⁇  of the imperial court and the shogunate government]), but in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi and Fushimi-jo Castles after the Restoration of Imperial Rule, he was ordered by the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) to hunt down and kill Edo-jo Castle and ordered the Imperial Court to surrender Edo-jo Castle without blood.
When he was confined to his house during the Meiji period, he devoted himself to his ⁇  and lived until the Taisho period as a prince.
Yoshinobu' is also read as 'Yoshinonobu' or 'Keiki' as his common name.
While he was in office as shogun, his official document of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) was recorded as 'Yoshihisa.'
Her name is also written as ' ⁇ ' in English and in English- ⁇  newspaper.
Although he is often called 'Yoshinobu' in his hometown Mito City, he is often called 'Keiki' in his childhood.
According to a person who knows Yoshinobu in his lifetime, Yoshinobu himself seemed to be fond of 'Keiki-sama' and he called himself 'Keiki' to his younger brother Akitabu TOKUGAWA.
It is said that Yoshinobu's successor, ⁇  TOKUGAWA, was also called 'Keikyu-sama' by people around the same time as Yoshinobu.
Although the two names of 'Keiki-sama' and 'Keiki-san' can be confirmed in modern times, the term 'Keiki-san' is rarely found in Shizuoka Prefecture, and the term 'Keiki-san' is often used even in the case of either case.
Although there are many people who call it "Keiki" as 'there are many members of the family related to the Taira clan,' there is a possibility that the use of the people of the Higo Domain, who were engaged in overthrowing the Shogunate, might have been ⁇  or ⁇  in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi.
On October 29, ⁇ , he was born as the seventh son of ⁇  KUKI, the ninth lord of the Mito Domain in Edo.
His mother was Princess Yoshiko (Yoshiko, the third Shogun, Iemitsu TOKUGAWA's lawful wife) whose lawful wife was Princess Yoshiko.
However, Iemitsu's real mother is said to be Oe no kata, the legal wife of her father Hidetada, but some say that Kasuga no Tsubone was the real mother of Kasuga no Tsubone.
His childhood name was ⁇ maro.
According to Nariaki's educational policy, he moved to Mito Domain for seven months after his birth, and taught many martial arts and martial arts from Seisai EIZAWA and others to Nariaki TOKUGAWA of Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family.
He seemed to have been ⁇  by Yoshinobu at that time, and at first, Nariaki didn't have an adopted son to another family, so he thought that he would remain in the care of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA, his eldest son (the eldest son) and ⁇  TOKUGAWA.
On September 1, ⁇ , ⁇  was ordered by the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) to inherit ⁇ maro from Mito Domain to the heir of the Hitotsubashi family.
In response to this, ⁇ maro returned to the Hitotsubashi family on September 1, and in December, he was granted a portion of the real name of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA from the 12th Shogun Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA.
Ieyoshi often visited the Hitotsubashi residence, and considered Yoshinobu as an influential candidate for Shogun's heir, but he gave up receiving advice from roju (member of shogun's council of elders) Masahiro ABE.
In 1853, during the confusion in the ⁇  of the Black Ships, Ieyoshi died of illness, and Iesada TOKUGAWA, the 13th shogun of the Tokugawa family, who succeeded Ieyoshi's position as Shogun, was sickly and sickly, and there was a problem that 'the heir to the Shogun should be chosen' (the issue of Shogun's heir).
The Hitotsubashi group, consisting of Nariaki TOKUGAWA and Masahiro ABE, the lord of the Satsuma Domain, ⁇  TOKUGAWA, and Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA, the lord of the Kishu Domain, and the ⁇  group, which supported Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA, the real mother of Iesada and Honjuin.
The Hitotsubashi group tried to put Tenshoin, the adopted daughter of Nariakira SHIMAZU, into O-oku (the inner halls of Edo Castle where the wife of the Shogun and her servants reside), in O-oku (the inner halls of Edo-jo Castle where the wife of the Shogun and her servants reside), but after Masahiro ABE and Nariakira SHIMAZU died one after another, the Tairo (chief minister) Naosuke II, who became Tairo (chief minister) died in 1858, agreed to 'the heir to the Shogun, Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA.'
In the same year, Naosuke II signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan without imperial sanction.
Yoshinobu, together with Nariaki, the lord of Fukui Domain, Nariaki TOKUGAWA, and others, ⁇ ed Nariaki TOKUGAWA, but in the following year, 1859, he was ordered to retire and put under house arrest (An Ansei no Taigoku).
When Yoshinobu himself did not want to become heir to the Shogun, he sent a letter to Nariaki saying 'I don't want to do it, but I do not want to do so because of his failure in the world.'
In 1860, he was suspended from office.
In 1862, Imperial envoy ⁇  ⁇ , a guard of Satsuma Domain led by Hisamitsu SHIMAZU, went to Edo and ordered Emperor Komei to appoint Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA as Shogun's guardian and appoint him as Tairo (chief minister).
On July 6, the Edo bakufu appointed Yoshinobu as the guardian of the shogun, and ⁇  as the president of political affairs.
Yoshinobu and ⁇  implemented the reformation of the shogunate government called Bunkyu Reform, and established Kyoto ⁇  (Military governor of Kyoto) and ⁇  (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo) and ⁇  (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo).
In 1863, he went up to Kyoto as an attendant to Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA, and played an important role in negotiations with the Imperial Court against the expulsion of foreigners.
When Emperor Komei visited Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine to pray for the expulsion of foreigners by prayer for the expulsion of foreigners in prayer for the expulsion of foreigners, he ordered Iemochi to have an audience with him, saying that he would carry out the expulsion of foreigners.
When the Sonno Joi ha (supporters of the doctrine of restoring the emperor and expelling the barbarians) led by the Choshu clan was expelled due to the Coup of August 18 (old calendar), he went to Kyoto again to participate in the Sanyo-kaigi (a council of state) with the support of Kobu Gattai ( ⁇  between the imperial court and the shogunate) and the Shogunate.
However, judging from the fact that the conference was held by the council, he was drunk at a drinking party with Imperial Prince Kuninomiya ⁇  and was drunk at a drinking party, ⁇ ing ⁇ -jo Castle, ⁇ -jo Castle, ⁇ -jo Castle, and ⁇ -jo Castle, and furthermore, he tried to break up the system by saying, 'I have been ⁇  by Shimazu's forces,' and furthermore, he tried to stop the collapse of the system.
After that, he was appointed as Kinri Goshuei Sotoku (Governor-General of the Imperial Palace Guard) by the Imperial Court in Kyoto, and along with ⁇  MATSUDAIRA (the lord of Aizu Domain), ⁇  MATSUDAIRA (the lord of Aizu Domain), Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA (the lord of Kuwana Domain), and ⁇  MATSUDAIRA (the lord of Kuwana Domain), he was a pro-Imperialist and court nobles (Ichibashi, Aizu and Kuwana Domains).
During the Tenguto no Ran ( ⁇  of Tenguto), he showed his coolness to cut down the vassals of his parents and Mito Domain, including ⁇ sai TAKEDA, who supported Yoshinobu.
In 1864, he attacked the army of bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) at the Kinmon Incident, and attacked the Choshu army which occupied Takatsukasa's residence.
Following this, he was involved in the conquest of Choshu, and worked hard for the Imperial sanction for the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan, and succeeded in obtaining imperial sanction on the condition.
In the second conquest of Choshu in 1866, Yoshinobu received an imperial order to attack Choshu by suppressing the Satsuma Domain's ⁇ .
However, due to the rejection of the Satsuma clan's dispatch of troops to Satsuma, the bakufu army was defeated.
On August 20, during the second conquest of Choshu, Shogun Iemochi died in Osaka-jo Castle.
Yoshinobu took the Imperial Court's movement to ⁇  the imperial rescript and concluded a peace agreement.
Although Iemochi was recommended to succeed Iemochi, Yoshinobu refused this proposal.
On August 20, the Tokugawa Shogun family inherited the position of Shogun, but he refused to assume the position of Shogun.
Later, roju (member of shogun's council of elders) and other roju (member of shogun's council of elders) asked Katamori MATSUDAIRA, but they did not accept it, and on December 5, they became Shogun by the recommendation of the Emperor Komei.
This was because he was forced to become a shogun by selling favors, and there was a rumor that he would take advantage of politics.
Yoshinobu received an assistance of 240 million dollars from France through Leon Léon, the French minister, and established ⁇  Seitetsusho (a trading house) and Shusensho (a government office in charge of casting and appraising of gold during the Edo period), and implemented the military system of military affairs, including Jurrene Brene.
Also, he encouraged his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA to study in Europe, such as sending his younger brother Akitaka TOKUGAWA to Paris.
At the problem of the opening of Hyogo port, he insisted on the Imperial Court and obtained permission from the Imperial Court.
Yoshinobu, who was ⁇  to 'the secret imperial command to attack the shogunate' to the Satsuma and Choshu clans, reported to the Imperial Court on October 14, 1867 (the Taisei Hokan [transfer of power back to the Emperor]).
It is said that the Imperial Court at that time had no administrative ability, and it was said that they were trying to maintain the Tokugawa government by leading the council of feudal lords.
However, due to Toshimichi OKUBO and Tomomi IWAKURA's plan to overthrow the Shogunate, the Decree for the Restoration of Imperial Rule was issued in December, and Yoshinobu was ordered to 'jikannochi' ( ⁇  dismissal and ⁇  of the Tokugawa family).
Yoshinobu left Osaka-jo Castle in order to avoid conflict, provoked ministers from foreign countries and insisted on Tokugawa ⁇  (three privileged branches of Tokugawa family), and furthermore, he made a petition to the Imperial Court to change Jikan nochi (an application for resignation) to the Imperial Court.
However, in the following year, 1868, when the Satsuma Domain took part in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, he raised an army and attacked Kyoto using Aizu and Kuwana Domain soldiers.
However, when the army of the former bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) was ⁇  in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi which broke out on January 3 (January 3 under the old lunar calendar) and the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, the army of the former bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) lost its military strength and retreated to Edo in "Kaiyo Maru" (Kaiyo Maru Warship).
Soon after, the order to track down and kill Yoshinobu as the Emperor's enemy was issued, and the Imperial army, which was led by Dai Sotoku (Governor-General of the Dazai-fu [local government office in Kyushu region]), led by Dai Sotoku-fu (Governor-General of the Dazai-fu offices), launched an expedition to the east.
Yoshinobu insisted on ⁇ ing his allegiance by suppressing the resistance force led by ⁇  ⁇ .

On the other hand, there is an anecdote that when he was about to sleep after his coming of age, he met with his wife and two mistresses to become 'Y' with the same Chinese character as 'Y'.
The photograph of Yoshinobu is said to be a photograph of Yoshinobu, but it is not considered that the photograph was made in Japan at the time of Yoshinobu's young age, so it is not clear whether Yoshinobu himself was himself.
It is said that he often visited Iemochi when he fell ill.
He was known for his ⁇ , and ⁇  AJIMA, his biological father-in-law, praised Yoshinobu as 'Kiyotada TOKUGAWA, who cleaned the Tokugawa lineage' and assumed the position of shogun with the hope of restoring the Tokugawa shogunate, and praised him as ' ⁇  Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.'
Hideaki, who was on the side of the overthrow of the Shogunate, was a member of the pro-shogunate group, and especially Takayoshi KIDO of the Choshu clan, 'It is impossible to ⁇  Yoshinobu ⁇ 's ⁇ .
He seemed to have been watching Ieyasu again.'

Even if you don't follow, you will be able to ⁇  even if you don't accept it.
He gave an evaluation of his life for the public' to Yoshinobu, and tried to give him the position of vice chief adviser to the new government.
However, it was in the Meiji period when Yoshinobu knew that Ryoma was Ryoma's presence (after Ryoma's death).
There are no stories about Yoshinobu, and it is very interesting that Ryoma died while he was alive after the Meiji Restoration.
When he was defeated in Osaka Natsu no Jin ( ⁇  Siege of Osaka) and fled to Edo, he was greatly criticized by his enemy's side.
At this time, although the use of kinogi ( ⁇  fans) had been handed down since Ieyasu, there were some who ⁇ ed the ⁇  of Yoshinobu's ⁇ .
However, there is an opinion that they needed to resist armed uprisings in Edo and Musashi Provinces at that time, and because Yoshinobu became the Emperor's enemy, they ⁇  from Osaka-jo Castle, and the long-term battle was necessary to prevent the intervention of foreign countries.
It is said that he was highly regarded as an enemy of the new government or because he was confined to Kanei-ji Temple, or because he was confined to Kanei-ji Temple by the Emperor (it is thought that he was influenced by Mitogaku (the scholarship and academic traditions that arose in the Mito Domain) and his mother was from the Imperial Family), but on the other hand, he did not respond to the fact that he was ⁇  to the enemy as his master.

 ⁇  ⁇ , a businessman, was employed as a retainer when he was the head of the Hitotsubashi-Tokugawa family, and after the Meiji Restoration, he was assassinated.

"Konjaku Monogatari Shu" (The Tale of Times Now Past) is a collection of anecdotes.
In the chapter which is recorded in some zadan-kai (a group of talks between the court and the shogunate), it can be seen that the voice of Yoshinobu in the wedding ceremony can be seen.
It can be said that his character and heart of the time can be seen from the fact that he was a person who did not like him when he was just one year old, and he said, 'I don't like ⁇ ,' 'I don't like you,' 'I don't like you,' and 'I am a ⁇  person.'
Based on these materials, " ⁇  Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA Koki" was completed after Yoshinobu's death.
When he was pardoned as the Emperor's enemy, Yoshinobu expressed his will to express his gratitude to the Emperor Meiji, who was given the highest rank of the peerage, to express his gratitude for his funeral, instead of a Buddhist ceremony.
Therefore, in the graveyard of the Tokugawa family, which was the family temple of the Tokugawa family, there was no grave in the graveyard of the Tokugawa family in Kanei-ji Temple, and a similar round ⁇  was built in Taninaka Reien.
This was due to the ⁇  of the imperial mausoleum of Emperor Komei (according to "Koyo ⁇  Koki" (Diary of Yoshinobu ⁇ )).
After the pardon, Katsukiyo ⁇ , a roju (member of shogun's council of elders) at that time, expressed his regret for Yoshinobu's life without worrying about his life, saying, 'It is regrettable that Yoshinobu should act together with Yoshinobu.'
There was an image of a weak person in ' ⁇ mae escape' in the Battle of Uji-gawa River, but after Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor), it has been ⁇  in recent years, and there is a movement to revaluate Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA (NHK Historical Drama) and so on.
Like his father Nariaki, he was fond of pork in Satsuma Domain, and was called ⁇  Ichisama ( ⁇ -sama, pork and pork were fond of ⁇ -sama).

He is famous as a ⁇ man, but it seems that his technique of shooting was not advanced.

▁Note
Nara Line is a railway ( ⁇ ) operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West) from Kizu Station (Kyoto Prefecture) in Kizugawa City, Kyoto Prefecture to Kyoto Station on the Uji Line of the West Japan Railway Company (JR West).
The entire line is included in the suburbs surrounding Kitaoji-dori Street.
Because this station has a direct connection with the Kansai Main Line, its official starting point is Kizu Station, but the trains running from Kyoto to Kizu Station arrive at and depart from Kyoto Station (the number of trains is odd), and the inbound train makes up the inbound train (the number of trains is odd).
Except for the detailed data, it will be described in the direction of Kizu from Kyoto to Kizu.
Its selection is green tea, and the reason why the selection is said to be 'a ⁇  image of the old capital connecting two ancient capitals.'
The jurisdiction ( ⁇  type): West Japan Railway Company ( ⁇  operator)
Route distance (operation kilometers): 34.7▁km
Track gauge: ⁇ ▁mm
Number of stations: 19 (including the starting and terminal stations)
 ⁇ -track section: Shinden - Uji section, JR ⁇  - Kyoto▁section
 ⁇ ed section: entire line (DC 1500V)
 ⁇  ( ⁇ ) system: A ⁇  block system (track section) and a single track automatic block system (track section)
 ⁇  device: A ⁇  Train Stop▁system
Operation center: Shin-Osaka General Control▁Center
M ⁇  speed: ⁇  km/h, ⁇  km/h (track section)
Except for Kizu Station, this station is under the jurisdiction of the Kyoto Branch of West Japan Railway Company (Kizu Station is managed by the Osaka Branch Office of West Japan Railway Company).
As the name of the line, the line between Kyoto and Kizu is named Nara Line, but the entire line is located in Kyoto Prefecture, and there is no route in Nara Prefecture.
This was due to the process of separating the section from Kizu to Nagoya as a part of the Osaka - Nagoya route after the Kansai Railway was merged into Kansai Railway, but the section between Osaka and Nagoya was separated as a part of the Kansai Railway Company.
However, trains run from Kizu Station to Nara Station on the Kansai Main Line (Yamatoji Line) and arrive at Nara Station in Nara Prefecture.
JR West established the nickname of the line (JR Kyoto Line, JR Kobe Line and so on) in accordance with the revision of March 13, 1988, but the Nara Line was ⁇ .
Since Kintetsu Nara Line is located in Kintetsu Nara Line, it is sometimes referred to as 'JR Nara Line.'
In the era of Japan National Railways, it was referred to as ' ⁇  Nara Line of Japan National Railways,' and the English letter 'JNR' was also added to the announcement board.
Kintetsu Nara Line is related to the Yamatoji Line between Nanba Station and Nara Station, and the Kintetsu Nara Line is on the Kintetsu Kyoto Line, which is operated by the JR Nara Line.
While many trains on the Kintetsu Kyoto Line and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line had been operated in parallel before the electrification of the Nara Line until 1984 at the end of the JNR era, trains on the Nara Line weren't electrified, and even after the electrification of Japan National Railways, two-car trains of JR (West) ⁇  Train Series ⁇  and two-car trains ran on a narrow track.
However, since JR West was established and incorporated into the Urban Network after the inauguration of JR West, trains were upgraded to four-car trains (some of them were six-car trains), a double-track section became a double-track section, a double-track section became a double-track section, and a part of rapid trains such as rapid trains such as ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' ( ⁇ ji Rapid Service) and ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' ( ⁇ ji Rapid Service).
Today, the characteristics of commuters and students from the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, such as tourist attractions to Byodo-in Temple in Uji City along the line, and commuters from the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, such as Kawaramachi-dori Street.
However, it is largely divided into the east side of Momoyama Station and Shinden Station, and in the south of Joyo City, the section south of Joyo City, the Kintetsu Kyoto Line, which runs from the center of the town, is located in parallel with the traffic of ⁇  and regions.
The rolling stock of the Nara Train Depot, a branch office of the Osaka Branch, is used, but the station facilities are managed by the Kyoto branch office except for Kizu Station.
J- ⁇  cards, Suica of East Japan Railway Company (JR East), ⁇  of Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) and PiTaPa of KANSAI  ⁇  ⁇  can be used at all stations.
In the south of Joyo Station, a simple ticket gate is provided for convenience.
Since the 'Kuroshio (train)' running between Kyoto Station and Wakayama Station via the Nara Line, Sakurai Line and Wakayama Line was abolished in 1984, local trains had been operated until 1991 (as a limited express train was temporarily operated for a certain period of time, four types of rapid trains, rapid trains and local trains, local trains, local trains, local trains, and local trains).
This is the highest type of train operated on the Nara Line, and it is operated mainly in the daytime.
Basically, local trains and local trains are operated between local trains and local trains at intervals of 30 minutes.
The nickname ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' was chosen by the general public before the timetable was revised.
As trains connecting Kyoto and Nara, which are sightseeing spots, many tourists use not only Japanese but also foreign tourists.
The rolling stock of the JR (West) ⁇  Train Series 221 is operated by four-car trains or six-car trains.
Rapid trains run at ⁇  km/h on the Sanyo Shinkansen line, and at ⁇  km/h on the Sanyo Shinkansen line, the maximum speed is ⁇  km/h.
The standard time is approximately 44 minutes from Kyoto Station to Nara Station, and approximately 47 minutes from Nara Station.
The trains bound for Kyoto stop at Kamikoma Station or Tanakura Station on the way to Kyoto and arrive at the Miyakoji Rapid Service on the Nara route, which is different from the Miyakoji Rapid Service on the Nara route, so there is a slight difference between the inbound and outbound trains and outbound trains.
During the New Year's holidays, the train stopped at Inari Station for the purpose of visiting ⁇  Station during the New Year's holidays.
▁History
March 3, 2001: The operation started.
March 15, 2003: With the timetable revision, trains began to stop at Tofuku-ji Station and Tamamizu Station.
It is operated during the rush hour during the rush hour.
This stop also stops at JR Ogura Station and Shinden Station (Kyoto Prefecture) where the ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' runs.
The JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series ⁇  was operated with four-car trains or six-car trains.
Basically, local trains and local trains are operated between local trains and local trains at intervals of 30 minutes.
Like the Miyakoji Rapid Service mentioned above, there is a stop at Narayama Station where rapid trains on the Yamatoji Line stop.
Until March 2001, ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' was introduced, and JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series ⁇  was used in Kyoto, Uji, Joyo ( ⁇  at first) and Nara, and JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series 113 was used in the Nara Line, but after that, JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series ⁇  wasn't used.
As a result of the operation, there is a direct train connecting the Yamatoji Line and the Yamatoji Line.
It is operated mainly in the morning and at night.
Initially, it was operated only on weekdays but was also operated on ⁇  and holidays from March 18, 2006 to March 18,▁2006.
Although the trains between Uji Station and Uji Station used to run on the Uji Line at the end of the night, in the past there was a plan to drive local trains on the Kizu-gawa River at Shijo-Omiya Station, but today the local trains running in front of Shijo-Omiya Station were changed to the terminal timetable.
One of the trains that start from Kyoto Station on ⁇  and holidays are operated by JR (West) ⁇  Train Series ⁇ , all of which are operated by JR (West) ⁇  Train Series ⁇ .
There is a direct train from the Yamatoji Line to the Yamatoji Line in order to operate trains on the Osaka Loop Line.
The trains on the Nara Line used the color of the same color as ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' and ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' on the Yamatoji Line, but due to the revision of the timetable revision made in March 2008, the color of the trains on the Osaka Loop Line ceased to be used with green letters.
It is described in Shijimon ( ⁇  characters) on the front of Kamikoma Station.
It runs between Kyoto Station, Uji Station, Joyo Station and Kameoka Station.
During the daytime, the route between Kyoto Station and Joyo Station was operated every 15 minutes, but the section between Joyo Station and Kizu Station became 30 minutes.
Basically, the cars of the 103 series are operated by the 103 series, but some of them are operated by the ⁇  series.
Some trains run directly to the Yamatoji Line in the early morning and late in the morning and late at night.
In the past, there were sections of the Sakurai Line and the Sakurai Line, but on September 4, 1994, the Nara Line and Sakurai Line were divided into two lines.
Although it is unmanned, trains on the Nara Line sometimes run on the Nara Line.
From 1987 to 1988, with the nickname 'Kuroshio (train)' and 'Kuroshio (train)' from 1988 to 1989, it was operated via the Kansai Main Line, Hanwa Line, Hanwa Line, Hanwa Line and Hanwa Line between Kyoto Station and Shirahama Station.
On January 6, 1998, in the Kinki edition of the timetable revision made on January 6, 1998, there was a report that the limited express would be operated on the Nara Line (as a regular train on the Nara Line), but the plan was later cancelled.
There was a time when the Miyakoji Rapid Service was operated between Kyoto Station and Sakurai Station (between Kyoto Station and Nara Station for Miyakoji Rapid Service), but currently there are no special express trains to the Sakurai Line including special rapid trains.
During mid-August, the Uji-gawa River Flower Festival, which is the nearest destination to the Uji-gawa River, is operated every special schedule until the end of the 16th timetable, because it's impossible to secure transportation capacity, all of the local trains have been operated at intervals of approximately 10 minutes between Kyoto Station and Uji Station since the 16th century.
Some local trains arrive at and depart from Kizu Station.
The timetable of March 3 at that time was a special schedule for a single single track, and Rapid trains were operated between Kyoto Station and Uji Station, as well as the frequency of operation between Uji Station and Uji Station.
Depending on the year, some trains began making stops at Momoyama Station.
Around 1992, special rapid service was extended to Sakurai Line, mainly on ⁇  and holidays, and one hour was operated between Tenri Station and Tenri Station.
In addition, the trains that are exclusively operated exclusively for groups throughout Japan are sometimes sometimes operated.
In particular, when the Tenrikyo ⁇ tai on October 26 every year, trains that are operated directly from Kyoto Station to Tenri Station via the Nara Line, the Nara Line, the Yamatoji Line, the Yamatoji Line, the Yamatoji Line, the Nara Line, and the Sakurai Line, all of which are operated every year.
All of them belong to Nara Train Depot.
JR (West) ⁇  Train Series<unk>
There are two types of cars, four-car trains and six-car trains as well as the Yamatoji Line and the Osaka Loop Line.
It is mainly used for ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' and ' ⁇  Rapid Service' or ' ⁇  Rapid Service,' but mostly four-car trains on the Nara Line use four-car trains on the Nara Line.
Two-car trains and two-car trains can be seen on holidays.
JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series▁103
Rapid trains of the 103 series, which are used for local trains on the Nara Line, are operated not only on the Nara Line but on the Nara Line, but also on the Osaka Loop Line and the Yamatoji Line during rush hour.
Some of the cars are transferred from the Morinomiya Train Depot to the cars transferred from the Morinomiya Train Depot.

Keiji Bypass (Keiji Bypass, Anglo-PSSSSSSSSS) is a general Bypass that extends from Kusatsu City, Shiga Prefecture to Kumiyama Town, Kuse County, Kyoto Prefecture.
It is designated as a plan for local high- ⁇  highways.
The Keiji Bypass on the Keiji Bypass of Yuryo Road first ⁇ s the Keiji Bypass of the National Highway Route No. 1 and 24 of the Keiji Bypass.
It is connected with Meishin Expressway, and connects with Meishin Expressway in Otsu City and Kyoto City, and connects to ⁇  Interchange of Meishin Expressway, Nagoya City, and ⁇  Interchange and Osaka City.

As a result of the future plan, the construction of a road connecting Kyoto Tanba Road and Keiji Bypass, which were the National Highway 9 Bypass, to connect the Kyoto- ⁇  Road and the Keiji Bypass, which had a function of the ⁇  of Meishin Expressway and Kyoto Municipal Subway.
The Kyoto L ⁇  Expressway and the Kyoto Second Outer R ⁇  Expressway have been designated as National Highway Route No. ⁇ , and the maintenance of the road has been maintained.
According to the indication of the route, it is described as Keiji Bypass at Seta Higashi-Maizuru Station and Oyamazaki Station on the Keihan Uji Line.
There are no differences between the Meishin Expressway and the Keiji Bypass via either routes or the ETC discount system.
If no special mention is made, Keiji Bypass (from Setahigashi Interchange to Oyamazaki Station) is used as the name of a business operator.

Prior to the opening of the Kumiyama ⁇ , the film "THEVICE II Standing Statue" was shot in the movie before the opening.
Seta Higashi IC - the distance of the Oyamazaki IC and the Hirakata Bypass is shorter than that of the Meishin Expressway, and if you pass through the Keiji Bypass, you will go to the destination earlier than the Keiji Bypass.
Because there are no ⁇  facilities such as services in the service area, there are many cases where the Meishin Expressway is more expensive than the Meishin Expressway (there are two ⁇ s in the Otsu Service Area and the Katsuragawa ⁇  Area).
However, due to the fact that both sides of the Seta Higashi and Oyamazaki stations were built after the god's name (especially the structure of the Oyamazaki Cable Cars), they were forced to reduce the speeds in the LD ( ⁇  Expressway) section.
There is an opinion that if you go from Oyamazaki Station to ⁇  Station or arrive at the left side of Meishin Expressway, you may join the Meishin Expressway.
Also, there are many ⁇ s and slopes on the way, so it's impossible to function as a ⁇  for Meishin Expressway because there are many ⁇ s connecting them.
This road is a ⁇  for motor vehicles because it is a ⁇  of National Highway Route No. 1 (National Highway) and is not a high-speed drive route.
If you go from the east side of the Uji-gawa River to the Keiji Bypass of ⁇  and Kumiyama-cho, you must go to the west of Uji-nishi Interchange.
This is because the Ujihigashi Interchange is a ⁇ .
Therefore, there are many general roads between the Ujihigashi Interchange and the Ujinishi Interchange during the commuter hours.

Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is a god (Shinto) appearing in Japanese Mythology.
In the "Engishiki" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), 'Amateru' is referred to as 'Amateru.'
It is a godification of the sun and is considered to be one of the ancestors of the Imperial Family (Kososhin).
In "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), it is described as Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) or in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan).
It is also known as ⁇  no ⁇  no Kami.
While several gods are described in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), in "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), they are unified under the name of 'Tenshodai okami' in "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters).
Although she is a goddess, there is another theory that she was actually a male god.
As the name Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is used in political parts such as "Kotai Jingu ⁇ cho" ( ⁇  of the Ceremonies for Kotai-jingu Shrine) and so on, there is a theory that ⁇  was originally the ancestral deity of the Three Shrines in the Imperial Court (Komusubi no mikoto) and Nishi ⁇  no mikoto was the ancestor of the Imperial Family and became Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
In Ise-jingu Shrine, it is usually called Amatsumara okami or Sume oomikami, and it is also called Amatsu kami okami no kami when chanting a name before a Shinto ritual.
Today, 'Takama' and 'Katakana' are extant in academic documents.
There is also a theory that it was written as 天 ⁇ 神 in ancient times.
Descriptions in▁mythology
According to "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), when Izanagi returned from the ⁇  (world after death) where Izanami was living and washed ⁇ , he was born when he washed his left eye when he washed ⁇ .
At this time, she was called ⁇  no Mikoto, along with her right eye and nose, and she was called ⁇ ko.
At that time, Izanagi ordered Amaterasu Omikami to ⁇  Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).
Susanoo, who was entrusted with the sea, was exiled by Izanagi due to his ⁇  that he wanted to go to the land of Izanami.
Susanoo met his older sister Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) before the conquest of Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains), but Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) thought that his younger brother, Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess), came to Takamanohara (plain of high heaven), and was given an armed force.
In order to ⁇  Susano's ⁇ , five male gods were born from the real world of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and three goddesses were born from Susano's real fruit, and Susano won the victory.
Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) was born from the ⁇  of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess), and Amaterasu Omikami was a child of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).

Susanoo, who was ⁇  by this, worked for Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains) in Takamanohara (plain of high heaven), and as a result, Amaterasu Omikami hid herself in Ashihara no ⁇  ( ⁇  Land of Reed Plains).
 ⁇  became apparent, and various misfortunes occurred.
Yaoyorozu no Mikoto, the god of Chichibu, and Ame no M ⁇  no Mikoto, the god of Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains), succeeded in driving Ame no ⁇  no Kami from the rock cave and Susanoo was expelled from Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).
Ame no M ⁇  no Mikoto sent his son, Amenooshihomi to ⁇  Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains).
Ninigi ruled Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains) and ⁇  no ⁇  (the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess), but Ninigi (the grandson of the sun goddess) gave birth to Ninigi (the grandson of the sun goddess) in order to ⁇  Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains).
The▁interpretation
In mythology, there is a view that Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) worshiped the gods by performing religious services (matsurigoto) in accordance with the instructions of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) (the Sun Goddess) who was born earlier than ⁇  (the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess) or Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) in accordance with his instructions.
There is also an opinion that it is a ⁇  of ancient shrine maiden.
Another name 'Hirume' is 'Hime no Onna' and it refers to a shrine maiden serving the sun god.
Although the sun god is originally a male god, there is a theory that a shrine maiden serving it was identified with the sun god and became a goddess.
There is also a theory that this goddess was established around the time of Empress Jito, and it is now said that Himiko was a model for Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
It is pointed out that the birth of 'moku' of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and Tsukuyomi no kami (the Sun Goddess) in the sun and Tsukuyomi no kami (the sun god of the moon) is described in "Reiho Gofu" (a preface written before the sixth century) (from the beginning of the seventh century) in "Reiho Gofu" (a preface to the end of the seventh century) of Taoism scriptures and "Kyori Gofu" (a commentary on the Lotus Sutra), and it is pointed out that it was strongly influenced by Dokyo.
Also, it is said that the concept of ⁇ , such as Ise-jingu Shrine, Ise-jingu Shrine, Ise-jingu Shrine, Saigu-no-miya Shrine, ⁇ -no-Miya, ⁇ -no- ⁇ , ⁇ -no- ⁇ , ⁇ -no- ⁇ , ⁇ -no- ⁇ , ⁇ -no- ⁇ , ⁇ -no-Miya, ⁇ -jinja Shrine, and so on, is the same as that of Kotai-jingu Shrine.
Based on the comparison of the mythological mythology, it is pointed out that the myth of the birth of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is almost the same as the Banko myth in ancient times (the third to fourth century).
In addition, there is a theory that it was a mythical myth introduced to Japan along with ethnic groups in the period of the preceding history because the sun rises in Asia spread throughout Asia.
According to one theory, in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), ⁇  transformed into three stages.
The following is a summary of the events and contents.
 ⁇ : The Taika Reforms were revised.
Before this, the Imperial Family did not follow Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
Hinokami' (the sun god) itself is called 'Hinokami' (the sun god).
The male god who was called 'Ateruteru' is widely known.
In "Engishiki" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), there are shrines with the pronunciation of 'Amateru-jinja Shrine' in Tsushima as well as 'Amateru-jinja Shrine' in Tanba, 'Amateru-jinja Shrine' in Harima.
Incidentally, Amenomateru is another name for Amenohoakari, a grandson of Amaterasu, and Amenohoakari is the earliest ancestor of the Owari clan, Tsumori clan and Kaibe clan.
Also, ⁇ 's younger brother was Ninigi, who was the grandson of ⁇ , and was the grandson of Emperor Jinmu.
672: Jinshin▁War
It is also called 'Ohirume no michi' (literally, 'a woman who worships the sun god') or 'a woman who worships the sun god'.
In this case, there are two interpretations: one is that the enshrined deity is Ohiru, and the other is that it is 'Ateru' of the male god of snake.
 ⁇ : The Kotai-jingu Shrine was built.
She is 'the ancestor of Amaterasu' and 'the ancestor of the Imperial Family.'
She is a goddess.
As the model of Empress Jito, she was created as a humanized god by nature.
After that, 'Tenteru' other than the Kososhin was called 'Amateruteru.'
For example, in "Shinsen ⁇ " (Newly ⁇  Register of Clan Names and Titles of ⁇ ) (around 1060), the part of 'Amateru' is read as 'Amateru no Kami' and the part of 'Amateruhiko no Mikoto' in "Sendai ⁇ " (Ancient Japanese History).
1880-1881: Controversy in Shinto circles over the enshrined deity of the Shinto ⁇  Shrine, which was established in ⁇ , Tokyo.
Shinto ⁇  insisted that 'Izumo school' should be united with 'Yugen ichinyo' and 'Yugen no kami' as the enshrined deities enshrined in the sanctuary of the ⁇  (the Bureau of Shinto Shrines) and Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) (the Sun Goddess) as well as ' ⁇  no kami' (the God of the Land of Reed Plains) as ' ⁇  no kami' (the God of Reed Plains) and ' ⁇  no kami' (the God of ⁇ ).
However, 'Ise-ha' (Ise school) which was the center of Shinto ⁇  was 'Tenchi Dai ⁇ ' (Great ⁇  of Heaven and Earth) presiding over the both worlds, and other gods opposed the idea of syncretization of Shinto with other subjects.
In the end, there were various theories, such as ' ⁇ -ha (the Izumo school) ⁇  the ⁇  of the ⁇  years from the age of the gods,' 'I should kill Senkeson, who had been ⁇  in the Imperial family since the age of the gods,' and so on.
Before long, this dispute was settled by the Emperor Meiji's decision (the Izumo faction was defeated) and the ⁇  of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) became the highest rank.
It is said that the government recognized the possibility of the creation of the creed system common in Shinto and that it was impossible to control the common people directly by the Fukko Shinto theory.
See the dispute on the enshrined deity of ⁇  Shinto Shrine.
 ⁇  ⁇  used another name 'Ohiruchimuchi' when he appeared in his novel to ⁇  Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
This is due to the fact that the term ' ⁇  Omikami' (the Sun Goddess) comes from the fact that the ancestor gods appear in the text, so that the sun god and the god of nature appear in the text, and the sun god are also called 'the great sun god.'
In fact, in the novel by ⁇  ⁇ , there is a description that he was not able to judge the ⁇ , the Battle of Nagashino, the Battle of Nagashino, and the Battle of Nagashino.
Masaatsu YASUOKA (1898 - 1983), who established Konkei Gakuin School, said 'There is a belief in Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) in Japan.
Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is the ideal of the world with the spirit of Japan.
The word 'iza' in Izanami and Izanagi says, 'iza' is the ideal of the world's ⁇ , the pioneers of the world, and the pioneers of the world.'
Shrines that enshrine Amaterasu▁Omikami
The shrines that enshrine Amaterasu Omikami are called ⁇ -jinja Shrines all over the country, but the main shrine is Naiku (inner shrine) of Ise-jingu Shrine ( ⁇ -jingu Shrine).
Kotai-jingu Shrine is one of the Three Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family that enshrines Yata no Kagami (also known as Yata no Kagami), one of the Three Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family.
Most of the shrines throughout Japan enshrine the Shinsatsu (Daijingu taima) of Kotai-jingu Shrine (Amateru-Daijingu Shrine).
Daimyo (Japanese territorial lord) is a term that refers to the lord of a daimyo (Japanese feudal lord).
It also refers to a person who has a great name.
The term "tsuitoshi" refers to a small person.
The word "mono" originally referred to those who extended their power in the provinces.
Among them, in the samurai society, it became the word meaning a samurai who owned many territories and subordinates.
In the Muromachi period, shugo (provincial constables) strengthened their control over their territory and became shugo daimyo (shugo, which were Japanese provincial military governors, that became daimyo, which were Japanese feudal lords).
During the Sengoku period (period of warring states), a large feudal lord who established chigyo-chi (territory) appeared and was called Kokujin (local samurai) or Sengoku daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period).
During the Edo period, the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) gave shoryo (territory) of more than 10,000 koku (approximately 1.8 million liters of crop yield) to the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
Among samurai with a stipend of less than 10,000 koku, samurai under the direct control of the bakufu were called jikisan.
Since feudal lords share the character of feudal lords in common with lords in China, they were treated as daimyo (Japanese feudal lords) by ⁇ ing feudal lords.
This section describes the details of the early-modern daimyo in the Edo period.
Refer to the section on shugo daimyo (shugo, which were Japanese provincial military governors, that became daimyo, which were Japanese provincial military governors, that became daimyo, which were Japanese feudal lords) and Sengoku daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period).
 ⁇ -ji▁Temple
Karoku (hereditary stipend) during the Edo period was determined according to Kakaku (family status), official court rank, kokudaka (crop yield), yakuryo ( ⁇  of crop yield), and yakuseki ( ⁇  rank).
Firstly, due to the relationship with the Tokugawa Shogun family, it was classified into the Oie family (Shinpan, Shinpan daimyo), Fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) who were mainly vassals of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara, Fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family), and Fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) who became vassals of the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara.
The first shogun, Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, ordered the Owari Tokugawa family, the Owari Tokugawa family, and the Owari Tokugawa family to keep the existence of the Shogun family, and the Mito Tokugawa family, who were allowed to control daimyo throughout the country, to keep the Tokugawa family's control over the country, and to assist the Shogun family, and ⁇  TOKUGAWA, the ninth son, was appointed to the Owari Tokugawa family, and ⁇  TOKUGAWA, the tenth son of the shogun, was appointed to the Mito Domain.
In addition, Ieyasu appointed Hideyasu YUKI, the second son of the second Shogun Hidetada TOKUGAWA and Ieyasu's second son, to the Echizen Domain, as well as daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) of the Tokugawa family throughout the country.
In addition, fudai daimyo (hereditary vassals to the Tokugawa family) who had established the Tokugawa Shogun family for a long time were appointed to Fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) as fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) as fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family), and in order to secure the military power of the bakufu, they were appointed to important posts, such as Tairo (chief minister) of the bakufu and roju (member of shogun's council of elders), and assisted the shogunate government.
The fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) were relatively low, and the fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family), such as the Torii clan, the ⁇ bara clan, the Honda clan, the Honda clan, and the Ogasawara clan, were relatively large, but in the Edo period, fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family), fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family), including the Sakai clan, the Abe clan, the ⁇  clan, the ⁇  clan, the ⁇  clan, the ⁇  clan, the ⁇  clan, the ⁇  clan, and the Toda clan, were allowed to have more than 100,000 koku.
This became the reason for separation of power and military power.
The tozama daimyo (nonhereditary feudal lords) were subordinate daimyo after the Battle of Sekigahara, and many of them were opposed to the Tokugawa family in the Battle of Sekigahara.
For this reason, the ⁇  of the bakufu was strong and actively engaged in ⁇  activities, and if there were fears of ⁇  or rebellions, they were strictly punished.
Among the major tozama daimyo, there were many tozama daimyo (nonhereditary feudal lords) such as the Kaga Domain, the Satsuma Domain, the Satsuma Domain, the Sendai Domain, the Sendai Domain, the Sendai Domain, the Sendai Domain, the Kira clan, the Mori clan, the Uesugi clan, the Uesugi clan, the Yonezawa Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Hiroshima Domain, the Tosa Yamauchi clan, and the Satake clan, and the Akita Domain.
In addition, the status of daimyo was divided according to the status of "daimyo" (feudal lord) or "daimyo" (lord of a castle) whose territory was more than one province or more, "joshu daimyo" (lord chamberlain) who had a castle, "joshu" ( ⁇ ) or "joshu" ( ⁇ ) who had a castle, and "joshu" ( ⁇ ) whose castle was not allowed to enter the castle, and the daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) were allowed to participate in the Edo-jo Castle.
For details, refer to the section on ⁇ seki.
Based on the level of daimyo (Japanese territorial lord), daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) with 100,000 koku (a unit of volume: rice 1-koku is 180.39 liter; a unit of volume: rice 1-koku is 180.39 liter, lumber 1-koku is 180.39 liter, lumber 1-koku is 0.278 cubic meter) possessed territory as well as neighboring castles.
In the case of dynastic nation-state, one village was divided into another feudal lord and the other feudal lord ( ⁇ kyu).
Daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) had more than 10,000 koku in principle, but the Kirengawa Domain of the ⁇  clan was 5,000 koku.
This is because the ⁇  clan was descended from the Ashikaga clan.
Daimyo were controlled by the bakufu by the system of ⁇  (a system under which feudal lords were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo) and ⁇  (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo).
In addition, because he was ordered to protect the coastal areas during the end of Edo period or in the end of the Edo period, the daimyo were always in financial difficulties.

He was a daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) with a fine pattern.
In " ⁇ yoshu" (a dictionary compiled in the Muromachi period) in the Muromachi period, two sounds of 'taimei' and 'daimyo' were used, and the former indicated the meaning of Shugo (provincial constable) (Daisho) and the latter was ⁇ mochi (Fuyuso).
In the Sengoku period (period of warring states) (period of warring states), the distinction between 'taimei' and 'taimei' became ⁇ , and it is said that the word 'taimei' was often used.
In the early 17th century, two sounds of 'daimyo' and 'taimei' were also published, but the distinction between 'go' and 'taimei' was not clear, and both of them were considered to be major feudal lords.
The reason why the word 'daimyo' came to be commonly used in the Kansei Reforms was that it started to be called 'Myomyo' around the Kansei era.
