In the past, ⁇ , ⁇  is an error, and he is based on ⁇ , a ⁇  brother of ⁇ , who was born before ⁇  ⁇ .
Based on the ⁇  of the ⁇  ⁇  and the ⁇  of some ⁇ , the ⁇  will be ⁇ ed by the ⁇ .
However, there are many ⁇  between the same age, and there are many ⁇  that have a difference of age between 8 and 9 years old.

The ⁇  is the ⁇  of light ⁇ s, and the ⁇  is said to have ⁇ ed the position.
