Dogen was a Zen priest in the early Kamakura period.
He was the founder of Soto sect.
In his later years, he also used another name, Kingen.
In this religious doctrine, it is honorifically called Koso.
His shi (a posthumous name) was Joyo Daishi (a Buddhist priest) who was a Buddhist priest in Togoku (the eastern part of Japan, particularly Kanto region).
Generally, he is called Dogen Zenji.
It is said to have been invented in Japan, and the manners and customs of eating meals.
There is a theory that he brought back ⁇  (Ming ⁇ ) for the first time.
Although it is not clear how Dogen was born, there are various theories as to why he was born as the direct descendant of Naidaijin (Minister of the Center) Michichika TSUCHIMIKADO (MINAMOTO no Michichika or Michichika KOGA).
It is generally accepted that he was born as a child of FUJIWARA no Ishi, a daughter of Michichika and Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state) Motofusa ⁇  (FUJIWARA no Motofusa) at Matsudono sanso villa in ⁇ -ji Temple in Kyoto, but recent studies have become widely accepted that he was the biological child of ⁇  ⁇ , who is said to be his foster father.
There is also a theory that Michimune MINAMOTO or Michimitsu KOGA, the child of Michichika, was his father.
According to his biography "Kenpo-ki," he lost his father (Michichika) when he was three years old, and lost his mother at the age of eight, and became an adopted child of his older paternal half-brother ⁇  ⁇ .
According to another account, after his parents' death, he was adopted by his maternal uncle ⁇  ⁇  (former Sessho Naidaijin [Minister of the Center]) and the Matsudono family, but it is said that Dogen, who felt ⁇  for the world, refused it.
There is a theory that Shinran, the founder of Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism), was acquainted with each other on his mother's side.
There is a theory that the volume of ' ⁇ ' in his book " ⁇ " was written to Shinran.
In ⁇ , he visited his maternal uncle, Yoshiaki on Mt. Hiei.
In 1214, he became a priest with the title of Tendai-zasu (head priest of the Tendai sect), Koen, and took the name of Gappobo Dogen.
In 1215, he studied Tendai Sect teachings under ⁇  of Onjo-ji Temple.
In 1217, he studied under Meizen, a disciple of ⁇  at Kennin-ji Temple.
In 1223, he travelled from Hakata to Southern Sung Dynasty along with Ming Zen, traveled across the mountains, and received a certification of enlightenment from Nyojo ⁇  of Soto sect.
In 1228, he returned to Japan.
In ⁇ , he founded Kosho-ji Temple in Fukakusa, Kyoto.
Around this time, he was ⁇  by Mt. Hiei.
In August ⁇ , he was invited by Yoshishige ⁇ , jito (manager and lord of manor) of Echizen Province, and moved to ⁇  no sho (manor) in Echizen Province.
On the way, he stopped at Kutsuki Village in response to the invitation of Nobutsuna SASAKI, the feudal lord of Kutsuki-mura Village (the origin of Kosho-ji Temple [Takashima City])
In ⁇ , he founded ⁇ -ji Temple in Kasamatsu.
In ⁇ , he changed ⁇ -ji Temple to ⁇ -ji Temple and changed his go (pen name) to ⁇ .
Around this time, he went down to Kamakura to teach the regent Takatoki HOJO and Yoshishige ⁇ .
The period of edification in Kamakura was a half year, but it became a ⁇  arrow for the prosperity of Zen Buddhism in the Kanto region.
In ⁇ , he handed over ⁇  to his disciple, Koun Ejo, due to illness, and died at the residence of Kakunen, his lay disciple, (Takatsuji-dori ⁇ -dori Street, Kyoto City) at the age of 54 (53 years old).
It is said that he died of smallpox.
Buddha is not completed by a certain level of Buddhahood, and even if it is true, it is the essence of Buddhahood (Shusho Ichinyo) to continue ascetic practices in order to become a Buddha, and he insisted that it is the best ascetic practice (shikan Uchi ⁇ ) to be done in mediation (shikan uchiza).
Many Kamakura Bukkyo (Buddhism in Kamakura) accepted the legitimacy of the Tachikawa-ryu school, but in the Shogen ⁇  Zuimonki ( ⁇  of the True ⁇  of the True ⁇  of the True ⁇  of the True ⁇  of the True ⁇  of the True ⁇  of the True ⁇  of Buddhism) it is completely different from the fact.
It is a ⁇  of ⁇  for a while because it has a shozomatsu (the end of the Buddha statue) in Buddhism.
There is no true teaching.
It is the best of everyone.
It is not always possible to win all the hills in the world.
There is also a ⁇  mind or a root in the ⁇ .
It is to divide Buddha and ⁇  precepts, to all living things, and to ⁇ .
People are all of the Buddhism.
It is said that Mappo (Age of the ⁇  Dharma) was nothing more than a theory of Mappo (Age of the ⁇  Dharma) because it was the only person who was excellent among the disciples of the time of Shakyamuni, and it is said that it should be better to be able to attain Buddhahood.'

Umekoji Steam ⁇  Museum, located in Kankiji-cho, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a facility for the preservation of steam locomotives operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West).
On October 10, 1972, the Japan National Railways ( ⁇ ) designated steam locomotives, which had been supporting railway transportation, as precious industrial cultural properties for a century, as Japan's first industrial property, as Japan's first facility for the purpose of preservation and ⁇ ing the railways in Umekoji Engine Ward, Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City, for commemorating the 100th anniversary of Japan's founding.
In 1987, JR West took over the division and privatization of JNR.
This facility itself is an active railway yard (Umekoji Railway Yard) and an inspection and test of Type DE10 of Japan National Railways owned by the Sagano Scenic Railway is also conducted.
In the first place, this facility was the beginning of the development of steam locomotives which had rapidly disappeared since the late 1960s.
At first, ⁇  Engine was the most likely candidate for preservation institutions in the premises of Oyama Station, Tochigi Prefecture, because it was close to Joyo City, but it is said that the area was located in 'the central part of Japan' and that there was a place of scenic beauty in the neighborhood,' and in 1970 Umekoji Engine Engine (then) was officially selected as a preservation body district.
As a general rule, vehicles for preservation were required to select the most formal car (the first car) in existence, but there were some cars that were not supposed to be preserved initially, such as the C62 type 2 machines.
The facilities consisted of "Bokuryo exhibition-kan" (the museum for steam locomotives) utilizing the fan-shaped ⁇  in the former Umekoji Engine Depot and the " ⁇  Materials Exhibition Hall" which was reconstructed and reconstructed by the former Nijo station building.
The folding fan-shaped ⁇  was made of reinforced concrete built in 1914, and it was designated as a national important cultural property along with the crossover of 5 traille (completed in 1915) on December 10, 2004 and the Hikikomi Line.
In the same year, 2004, he was selected as a civil engineering heritage for the selection of the Civil Society.
In 2006, the former Nijo station building (the exhibition hall) of JR West, the one-storied model steam locomotive, and one-story building of the repair work were designated as a subsidiary of the semi- ⁇  semi- ⁇  railways.
The former Nijo station building was the oldest wooden Japanese-style station building with a two-storey building in existence in Japan, which was built by the Kyoto Railway Company in 1904 as the head office, and it was built in Heian-jingu Shrine in consideration of the scenery.
Kyoto Railway was ⁇  in 1907 and was later used as a non- ⁇ al station, but in 1996 it was completed as an elevated station between Nijo Station on the Sanin Main Line ( ⁇  Line) and Hanazono Station (Kyoto Prefecture), and in 1997 it was relocated and restored within the main building and used as a entrance to the building, and the interior used as an old site of the museum as a museum for displaying materials.
It was designated as a cultural property by Kyoto City in April 1996.
In the fan-shaped ⁇ , 18 forms of 16 domestic steam locomotives produced from the Taisho period to the Showa period (16 forms of 17 cars at the beginning of the opening) are displayed and displayed.
At the beginning of the opening of the museum, the registration of the cars was basically the same as that of the 45th C53-type and the 2C 51st-type 239-type 2 locomotives, and the number of cars stored for the cars was fifteen, but as of 2006, the number of cars stored for the preservation was repeated several times and the number of ⁇ s is seven.
Five-car trains have been registered as cars even now, and two (C57-type 1, C56-type ⁇ -type ⁇ -type ⁇ -type) are provided on the main line, such as 'Yamaguchi (train)' on the Yamaguchi Line and 'Kita- ⁇  (train)' on the Hokuriku Main Line.
Except these two cars, the drivers can't run on the main line because they do not have all inspections although the cars need to be registered.
In addition, the 'SLs team-go' is operated on the track within the building by the ⁇  of the DC ⁇ s for displaying the museum.
This platform used to be displayed at the northern end of the premises where large-size cars are currently located (there used to be a ⁇  facility and park within the building), but it was changed from the route to the present-day Umekoji-koen Station via the Sagano Line, along with the relocation of the former station building of the Miyafuku Line.
Even today, the line has a function as an institutional district and is connected to a business line.
After the operation of the Takatori factory of West Japan Railway Company was closed, steam locomotives were also added.

It originates from 'Ume' meaning Umekoji.
All cars except the C62 type No. 1 that were designated as a special designation in 1976 were designated as semi-express trains in 2006 along with maintenance workers and maintenance workers.
In 1972, there was a procedure for transfer from the pre- ⁇  institutional district to the present day.

Shomyo is one of the traditional Japanese music.
It is a kind of religious music used for ceremonies by ⁇ ing a melody.
In Japan, it is also called Bonbai or Bonnoku.
It is written as  ⁇ 明 in the old Japanese syllabary characters.
It is one of the academic fields of ⁇  (five wise kings).
Gomyo refers to five kinds of learning fields of Shomyo (oningaku, bunhogaku), Kogyomyo (art and technical theory), Ihomyo ( ⁇ ), Inmyo (Ethics), Naimyo ( ⁇ ) (study of his own religious doctrines, and Buddhist studies).
It was introduced to Japan as Buddhism was introduced.
There is a record that a Buddhist memorial service using Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) was held at a Buddhist memorial service for the Great Buddha of Todai-ji Temple in ⁇ , and it is thought that Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) was often held during the Nara period.
In the early Heian period, Saicho and Kukai taught each Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) and became the basis of Tendai Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) and Shingon Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant).
Other Buddhist sects other than the Tendai sect and Shingon sect also have unique Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) of each sect, and they are still inherited.
Because Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s) was told by kuden (or kuden), there was no ⁇ .
Therefore, ⁇  was extremely difficult.
Later, hakase (master) was invented, which was equivalent to ⁇  (a person representing the master during his absence).
Also, each school has a special term of hakase (master).
However, hakase is a reference to ⁇ , and it requires ⁇  (or Roi) to learn Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) and it is impossible to maintain and inherit the school from his master to his disciples.
Therefore, it was necessary to train leaders and successors.
With various conditions, many schools were abolished.
The Tendai Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) was based on Saicho and developed independently.
After Saicho, Ennin and Annen flourished.
 ⁇ , the founder of ⁇ -in Temple, is known as Chuko no So (father of restoration).
In 1109, ⁇  built ⁇ -in Temple ( ⁇  Ward, Kyoto City) in Ohara, Kyoto.
The sango (literally, "mountain name"), which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple of ⁇ -in Temple in Ohara, was changed to Gyozan, a Chinese Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical sutra) of Shomyo-ji Temple.
Before long, the two temples of ⁇ -in Temple and ⁇ -in Temple became known as Ohara-ryu Uzan Shomyo.
In addition, Jakugen later formed a group, and Ohara had two lines of Shomyo (chanting of Buddhist ⁇ s).
Later, ⁇  revived Ohara Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant of Ohara).
Tanchi developed the trend based on the new theory of music.
Since then, he has played a central role in Tendai Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) and has been inherited by present-day Tendai Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant).
Shomyo of the Yuzu Nenbutsu sect, the Jodoshu sect and the Jodo Shinshu sect are the lineage of Tendai Shomyo.
Shingon Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant of the Shingon sect) was based on the one introduced by Kukai, and is not known.
It was after Shinga that Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant) was ⁇ .
Among them, Kancho can be said to be the Chuko no So (father of restoration).
He strived for the composition and maintenance of Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant).
Until the Kamakura period, there were many schools, but Cloistered Imperial Prince Kakusho founded four schools (Honsoin-ryu, Shinsoin-ryu, Daigo-ryu, Nakagawa-daishin-ryu).
The Shomyo of Kogi Shingon Sect declined and ceased to exist until the Edo period.
Honsoin-ryu, Shingiin-ryu and Daigo-ryu were abolished during the middle of the Meiji period.
Currently, it is divided into Chizan Shomyo (chanting of Chizan) (Kyoto and Shingon Sects), Buzan Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant of Mt. ⁇ ) (Nara and Hase-dera Temples) and Nanzan Shinryu School (Sanzan and Koyasan Shingon Sects, Kyoto and Kogi Shingon Temples).
Chizan Shomyo, ⁇  Shomyo (Buddhist liturgical chant of Mt. Omine), Chizan School of Shingon Sect, ⁇  School of Shingon Sect and Shomyo of Shingon Sect are originally derived from the Nakagawa Daishin School.
Raisho obtained the influence of Daigo-ryu school.
In 1583, when Negoro-ji Temple ( ⁇  Prefecture) was burned down by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI and fell into decline, Chizan and ⁇ -ji Temples formed a new school based on Daigo's old school.
It is characterized by the following characteristics: 'Rongi' of ⁇  and 'Shosho' of Chizan.
The school originated from the ⁇  School of Nanzanshin School (Kogi Shingon Sect line Shomyo [Buddhist liturgical chant]).
The Nakagawa-Daishin school was founded by Taishin DAIJO of Nakagawa-ji Temple in Nara Prefecture.
During the Joei era (1232-1233), Katsushin of Koyasan Rengedani and Sanbo-in moved his base to Mt. Koya.
Later, it was also called Mt. Koya, and was named Nanzan ⁇ -ryu.
He was the first lord of the Shinoyamashin school.
 ⁇ s such as Heikyoku ( ⁇  music), Yokyoku (Noh song), Joruri ( ⁇  narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment), and Joruri ( ⁇  narrative chanted to a shamisen accompaniment) can be said to have changed the meaning of Shomyo.
It greatly influenced a single piece of music.
Emperor Tenji (also pronounced Tenji)
Men.
626 - January 7,▁672
He was the 38th Emperor.
His ⁇  (a posthumous name) of Kunikaze was Amanomikotohirawake no mikoto/Amatsumikoto Sakiwake no mikoto.
His posthumous name was ⁇  or Katsuragi.
It is thought that he was called Katsuragi no Miko or Katsuragi no Miko while he was alive.
He is generally known as Naka no Oe no Oji no Oji no Oji (Naka no Oe no Miko).
Oe' means the crown prince, and 'Naka no Oe' means 'the next Crown Prince.'
▁Summary
He was the second prince of Emperor Jomei.
His mother was Takara no Himemiko (later Empress Kogyoku).
The Empress was her older paternal half-brother, ⁇  no Oe no Miko's daughter, ⁇  no Okimi.
He conspired with NAKATOMI no Kamatari and others to launch a coup d' ⁇ , and supported his uncle, Emperor Kotoku, and he himself became Crown Prince.
And he established the era name Taika and implemented various reforms ( ⁇ ing the Taika Reforms, the Battle of ⁇ ).
In addition, he was sentenced to death by being deprived of his power after the coup d' ⁇  such as the Battle of Toba-Fushimi.
Baekje was defeated by Tang and Silla in ⁇ , and sent King Hosho FUYO, King of Paekche, who was staying in the Imperial Court, to revive Baekje.
He stayed in Tsukushi to lead the help of Baekje, but in 661, Empress Saimei passed away (his death).
After a long period of time, he did not have any chance to succeed to the throne, but in ⁇ , he moved the capital to Otsu City after he died in the Battle of Yamazaki and he ascended the throne.
After the Battle of Hakusonko, Mizu-jo Castle, ⁇  fire and ⁇  were set up as part of the national defense policy.
In addition, the grades of cap rank were also promoted from the 19th to the 26th grade.
In 670, he made the oldest national family register in Japan, 'Koeuma Nenjaku.'
The Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan) says that Emperor Tenchi wanted his first prince, Prince Otomo to succeed to the throne.
However, in the Jinshin War, which occurred after the death of Emperor Tenchi, his younger brother, Prince Oama (Emperor Tenmu) was enthroned in cooperation with Prince Otomo.
After that, the Emperor of the line of Emperor Tenmu succeeded to the throne as Emperor Shotoku.
After Shotoku's death, ⁇  no okimi, the grandson of Emperor Tenchi, ascended the throne as Emperor Konin, and later became the line of Emperor Tenchi.
It is said that he sent four of his daughters (his) to Prince Oama as his wife because he was exiled from Prince Oama to Nukata no Okimi.
Brief Personal▁History
626: He was born.
On July 12, ⁇ , he was formally installed as Crown Prince.
August 24, 661 - Shosei (a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code)
February 20, ⁇  - ⁇  to the▁throne
On January 7, 672, he died at the age of 46.
(In " ⁇ " (The Mirror of the Present), there is a theory that he died of illness, saying, 'There is a theory that he was assassinated by Emperor Tenmu because he was killed in the mountains because he was said to be dead in the mountains.)
The fact that Emperor Tenchi did not ascend the throne for a long time is one of the mysterious stories in political history after the seventh century.
There are several theories about this.
It is a consideration for the Emperor Tenmu's power.
In other words, it is wrong to say that Emperor Tenmu was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi, and it is based on the theory that he was a son of Emperor Jomei before Empress Kogyoku married Emperor Jomei, and he was an older maternal half-brother of Emperor Tenchi.
Whether the year of his birth is the year of his birth is based on the death of Emperor Tenchi in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) and the death of Emperor Tenmu in some history books, the year of his birth is presumed to be the longest.
However, there is no contradiction between the same historical materials, and many historical materials have a difference in age between the ages of eight and nine.
On the other hand, there is a ⁇  that 'although his father is different, he is a younger brother,' and it is wrong to say that he was a younger brother of Emperor Tenchi,' but 'Nihonshoki' (Chronicles of Japan) says that he was the age of 16 when his father, Emperor Jomei, was enthroned, and the age he passed away.
Therefore, the year of his birth is 614, which was adopted by Honcho koin jounroku (the Emperor's family tree) and others.
A counterargument with "In ancient times, Emperor Tenchi and Emperor ⁇ , who had been in power before and after Emperor Tenmu, did not ascend the throne immediately.
For this reason, errors occurred.
Some people say that it is not treated as the same because it is a counterargument with "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) and other history books differ from the time when they were compiled.
(Refer to the section on the age of Emperor Tenmu.)
There is a theory that Prince Arima was a coup d' ⁇  by Prince Karu (Emperor Kotoku) and Prince Naka no Oe was driven out of his position.
In recent years, it has been pointed out that the relationship between Prince Naka no Oe and Prince Naka no Oe was relatively good and the basic policy was similar to that of Prince Naka no Oe.
Then, Prince Naka no Oe had no ⁇  to kill Iruka.
Also, since the description of Taika no ⁇  (Great Reformation of the Taika Era) in Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan) was recognized, this theory came to be advocated.
In addition, this theory has attracted attention because it can explain other questions, for example, the reason why Emperor Kogyoku abdicated the throne and the reason why the Soga clan did not expel Iruka even after the coup d' ⁇ .
There is a theory that Emperor Tenchi was enthroned due to his ⁇  against women.
This is based on a poem written by Emperor Kotoku in the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan) to his wife, ⁇  no Himemiko (the Emperor Tenchi's grandchild), which ⁇ s the ⁇  relationship between her and Tenchi.
The love and marriage between a sister of ⁇  was permitted, but it was a love situation among ⁇ 's sisters at that time, and it was interpreted that there was actually a relationship between ⁇  no Makibi and ⁇  no Makibi written by Sato ⁇  no ⁇ , and it was ⁇  that he had a relationship with his uncle Karu no Okimi (Emperor Kotoku) after he was persuaded, and there were scenes in which he was furious about it.
After the death of Empress Saimei, there was a theory that ⁇  no Himemiko succeeded to the throne as a wife of the emperor, but there was a possibility that there was no record for some reason.
This is because in "Manyoshu" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves), a person named 'Nakatsu no Mikoto' comes from the theory of ⁇  no Himemiko, and 'Nakatsu no Mikoto' can be interpreted as an ⁇  emperor until the enthronement of Emperor Tenchi.
If there is a theory that ⁇  no Himemiko was called 'Nakatsu no Mikoto,' it may be ⁇  that she was specially called as such, but there is a theory that she was Empress Saimei and there is no ⁇  evidence.
Although it is difficult to prove it because of the nature of political history and the restrictions of historical materials, research progress has been expected, including cooperation with the results of the results of the ⁇ .
Songs
He was also a poet of Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) whose four poems were handed down.
In Ogura Hyakunin Isshu (the Ogura Anthology of One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Poets), there is a poem as the founder of the Heian Dynasty, and the following poem is included at the beginning.
Aki no Ta no Iho no Iho no Ikimi wo Isami, I'm ⁇ ing my clothes, but I don't care about it.
The following poems were selected from the Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).
Mt. ⁇  has a conflict with ⁇  no ⁇  and ⁇  no ⁇ , and has become stronger than the age of the gods, and it can be said that even ancient times have become ⁇ .
The Saionji family (the Kanin line of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan) was a court noble family descended from the Fujiwara clan.
He was a branch family of the Fujiwara clan, and his social standing was the Seiga family (one of the highest court noble families in Japan at that time).
The ⁇  family and the Imadegawa family (Kikutei family) were divided into the Saionji family.
Also, the Saionji clan, a samurai family in Iyo Province, was one of the powerful branches who claimed themselves as the surname of Saionji.
The ⁇  (family crest) is Hidarimitsudomoe.
The Saionji family was founded by FUJIWARA no Michisue, the third son of FUJIWARA no ⁇ .
When Michisue's grandson MINAMOTO no Michichika was assassinated by MINAMOTO no Yoritomo's niece FUJIWARA no Yoritsune, he was put under suspicion of being confined to the Imperial Court as the leader of the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) during the Jokyu War, and after the war, he gained the confidence of the bakufu and gained control of the Imperial Court as the Minister of State, thereby increasing his social standing.
The family name Saionji comes from the name of ⁇ -ji Temple, which was the second residence of Kintsune in Kyoto (Kitaso villa, Kadono District, Yamashiro Province).
This hall is also known as Kitayamadono, and the current Kinkaku-ji Temple was built by Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA to transfer the land from the Saionji family.
He was supported by the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) since Kintsune, and had influence over the Sekke (line of regents and advisers) through the Kamakura period.
Sanekane SAIONJI married into Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama) and had his daughter marry the Cloistered Emperor Kameyama and Emperor Godaigo.
After his son, Kinhira SAIONJI, however, when Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama) started to occupy a distance from the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), the Jimyoin-to (imperial lineage from Emperor Gofukakusa to Emperor Gokomatsu) was reconciled and deepened confrontation with Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Kameyama).
Later, during the reign of Kinmune SAIONJI, the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) fell and the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) served as Mandokoro ⁇  (chief of Mandokoro, the Administrative Board).
Kinmune harbored ⁇  HOJO (Tokioki) who was the remnants of the Hojo clan, and assassinated Emperor Godaigo who started the Kenmu Restoration, conspired with the Retired Emperor Gofushimi of Jimyoin-to (imperial lineage from Emperor Gofukakusa to Emperor Gokomatsu), and the plan was exposed by Kinshige SAIONJI, his younger brother, and the plot was arrested and executed.
During the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, Sanetoshi SAIONJI, a son of Kinmune, served the Northern Court (Japan) and became Udaijin (Minister of the Right) and restored the family name.
During the Muromachi period and the Edo period, the family specialized in biwa (Japanese lute) as their family business.
During the Muromachi period, ⁇  SAIONJI welcomed ⁇ , the eldest daughter of Tadataka HOSOKAWA (later disinherited) HOSOKAWA, as ⁇ 's wife, to become Sadaijin (Minister of the Left), but Kyumu ⁇ , who was a member of the Saionji family, gave him the family heritage of 600 koku (according to "The Record of ⁇  ⁇ ").
At the end of the Edo period, Kinmochi SAIONJI was adopted from the same political party as the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, and after the Meiji Restoration, he played an active role as a politician and became a prime minister, leading to the political world in the Taisho and Showa periods.
Incidentally, although Kinmochi was suffering from playing the biwa (Japanese lute) that was supposed to be the family business of the Saionji family, he was said to have been ⁇  by Emperor Meiji while he was serving as prime minister, 'I want to listen to the biwa (Japanese lute) of the Saionji family for a long time,' and there is a story that he was forced by the staff of Utaryo (Bureau of Traditional Music) and biwa (Japanese lute) of the Imperial Household Ministry to suffer four times.

"Makura no Soshi" (The Pillow Book) is an essay that is said to have been written by Sei Shonagon, a female writer in the mid Heian period.
It is also written as 'Makura no Soshi,' 'Makura no Soshi,' 'Makurazoshi,' and 'Shunzuisho,' and the oldest Kamakura period manuscript Maedabon ⁇  box describes "Sei Shonagon Makura no Soshi."
It was also called "Sei Shonagonki."
He was a renga (linked verse), haikai ( ⁇ -syllable verse) and kana zoshi (storytelling with kana characters) in later times as a pair of renga (linked verse) of Chuko ⁇  ( ⁇ - ⁇  Literature) which corresponded to "Genji Monogatari" (The Tale of Genji).
Together with "Hojoki" (An ⁇  of My Hut) by KAMO no ⁇  and " ⁇  ⁇ " by ⁇  YOSHIDA, it is referred to as one of the three major historical books of Japan.
It is pointed out that "Gizan Zakki" (Gizan's ⁇ ) compiled by Rishoin, a Confucian scholar in the late Tang Dynasty, has a quite similar style, and there is no evidence to mention the ⁇ .
According to the ⁇  and the name of his life written in the end of the book, when Naidaijin (Minister of the Center) FUJIWARA no Michitaka presented ⁇ , who was still a court noble at that time, to his younger sister, FUJIWARA no Teishi, chugu (the second consort of the Emperor) and Emperor Ichijo, Sei Shonagon, who was asked by the Imperial Court to write "Shiki" (the emperor's diary), immediately replied, 'I am a samurai in the bed.'
This is because paper was given from the palace as it was. (There is no description in the Noin-bon manuscript missing 'Makura ni  ⁇   ⁇ ' (The Pillow of Noin-bon) and the Noin-bon complete book 'Noin-bon manuscript 'Noin-su ni  ⁇   ⁇   ⁇   ⁇   ⁇ ya' (The Book of Noin-bon, Sakai-bon and Maeda-bon))
It is commonly accepted that the name 'Makura no Soshi' comes from this.
According to Kazuhiko HAYASHI's "Makura no Soshi no kenkyu" (A Study of Pillow Book), he was acquainted with researchers such as ⁇ , Nobuo ORIGUCHI, and Tenshin ⁇ .
The following is a representative explanation about the meaning of makura.
Negu-setsu: A pun on the words 'Shiki (Shiki - Shiki - Shiki - Shiki) no makura' (a place to sleep)
The author's examination theory: For example, there are many chapters in which utamakura (a place famed in the Heian period),  ⁇  (a place famed in the Heian period) and terms are arranged.
Bishoroku-setsu ( ⁇  of Bishoroku) : It means a book that should be kept in Makuramoto (the Pillow Book) as Bishoroku.
 ⁇ -bon▁theory
There is no relationship theory.
However, there is no commonly accepted theory.
In addition, 'Makura no Soshi' (the Pillow Book) was used as a common noun for ⁇ ing beautiful colors in "Sarashina Nikki" (Sarashina Diary).
The first draft was written around ⁇  according to the same document, and MINAMOTO no Tsunefusa, a novelist, brought it from the author's house to the world.
After that, he was never heard of it, and there is a document which seemed to have been written around the end of the Kanko era.
The text of "Makura no soshi" (the Pillow Book) described in "Genji monogatari shimeisho" (The Tale of Genji's ⁇ ) contains no extant book, and the process of the creation of the text is not seen.
The differences between the ⁇  and the ⁇  are large.
It consists of three volumes, taking the form of zoyo.
It is a book with the Okugaki (postscript) of ⁇  (1228) written by FUJIWARA no Sadaie, who is thought to have been FUJIWARA no Teika.
It is considered to be the most ⁇  of the interpretation of the book because it is easier to read the book 'We will be ⁇ .'
It was classified into two categories according to the Liquor Tax Act.
The first-class book (Korui) - Started with the opening 70 tales such as 'Haru wa  ⁇ ' ( ⁇ s of spring and autumn), starting with 'Chiyogenaru mono' ( ⁇ s of this world).
230 stories.
The Yomei Bunko manuscript, the ⁇  Shozo, and the ⁇ ke▁manuscript
Group 2 ( ⁇ s) -▁300
The manuscript formerly owned by Yatomi Hamao, owned by ⁇  Library, owned by the Date family, formerly owned by the ⁇ ji family, formerly owned by Akika ⁇ , owned by the ⁇ ji family, owned by ⁇  Azusado Bunko.
It is said that the line was introduced by Noin Hoshi (one of the sisters was the wife of TACHIBANA no Norinaga, the biological child of Sei Shonagon) who was a cousin of Sei Shonagon.
It goes back to the end of the Kamakura period.
It is almost an established theory that the ⁇  version of the Noin-bon manuscript is inferior to the ⁇  version of the three-volume book because of the ⁇  of the Zenhon dispute.
It consists of 230 stories except for seventy stories at the beginning.
300▁stories
It has a variety of variations.
It is a book handed down in the Muromachi period.
The name of Sakai-bon comes from the fact that it was written by KIYOHARA no Shiken that Doha, a Buddhist priest of the Kegon sect living in Sakai.
It consists of two volumes.
He lacks a diary and a sequel.
 ⁇ in bon - ⁇  story.
There is a sequel to the transcription by FUJIWARA no Yukinari.
It is a book of ⁇  (imperial letter).
It is a ⁇  story book.
Two types mentioned above are added.
Sakai-bon, which is generally referred to, refers to this.
One volume: 107
Volume 2, 89
Three volumes: 102
Four stories, 32 stories.
5.  ⁇ :▁?
It has a variety of variations.
There is only a book handed down from the Maeda family (owned by Maeda Ikutokukai) in Kaga Province.
The box covered with gold-lacquered lacquer, and the box was called "Sei Shonagon Makura no Soshi" (The Pillow Book).
It is designated as an Important Cultural Property.
It is said to be the oldest surviving copy of "Makura no Soshi" (The Pillow Book).
Among them, the Sakaibon line ⁇ inbon is divided into two parts, " ⁇  ⁇ " (Collection of historical documents compiled by Hokiichi ⁇ ), and the Sakaibon manuscript is included in "Shinko  ⁇  ⁇ " (New Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).
Moreover, Noinbon was used as an original text for old-type printing (Kobai-kyo) in the early Edo period, and it became the mainstream of denpon until the modern times with commentaries such as "Makura no Soshi bochu" (The Pillow Book) and "Makura no Soshi Harutomisho" (published by Kigin ⁇ ).
However, in 1946, ⁇  TANAKA (1917-1987) re- ⁇  the third volume of the second volume of the book, and after the World War II, it was mainly published and read by the text.
On the other hand, "Makura no Soshi ⁇ " (Illustrated Handscroll of Makura no Soshi), a picture scroll of a white drawing created in the late Kamakura period, which seems to have been written in the three-volume ⁇ , exists in the text written by FUJIWARA no Yukinari.
Three-volume books, the second-volume book, has more than 300 chapters independent.
It consists of various sentences including 'Mushi' ( ⁇ s) such as 'Mushiha' ( ⁇ s), 'Suzajiki no mono' ( ⁇ s of trees), 'Utsukushiki mono' ( ⁇ s of things) and 'Utsukushiki mono' ( ⁇ s of things), 'Zuisoshodan' ( ⁇ s of the Lotus Sutra) which observations the nature of the four seasons, 'Zuishodan' which ⁇ s the court society around Teishi/Sadako's work, and so on.
However, the way of classification is not clear (for example, the first chapter 'Haruhabutae' is commonly accepted, but there are some ⁇ s).
It is written in a simple style of Japanese writing using Manyo-gana (a form of syllabary used in the Manyoshu [Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves]), and many of which are simple and light-colored ⁇ , but it reflects the decline of the Nakanokanpaku family and the misfortune of the death of the lord Teishi/Sadako, which reflects the ⁇  of ⁇ 's ⁇ .
The sophisticated sens of the author and sharp observations of things were combined, and the world of beauty of 'wokashi' was established in contrast to 'mono no aware' in "The Tale of Genji."
A positive▁evaluation
Makura no Soshi (The Pillow Book) was deeply fond of human existence and nature, so they were selected and formed as polynomial beauty in each rank (Mekadasaku).
Depending on the threads which are associated with the next to the next to the next, each chapter inside of each chapter, there is no distinction between ⁇ , ⁇ , and ⁇ , and the material of ⁇  is ⁇ ed by the expression of tenmaku (the sky of a horse).
The expression of ' ⁇ ' (such as ' ⁇ ' in spring) is a novelty that, following the ⁇  renkan ( ⁇ - ⁇  ⁇ ) such as 'Haru-Hana-cho' ( ⁇ - ⁇  in spring) seen in the early Edo period, the ⁇  of readers who were familiar with the traditional art of waka poetry, ⁇  the ⁇  of the ⁇  of the ⁇  of the readers who were familiar with the traditional art of waka poetry, and ⁇  the ⁇  of the ⁇  of the ⁇  (by Munetoshi FUJIMOTO).
It is a ⁇  of respect for chugu Teishi.
It was written to ⁇  the soul of Teishi, who had fallen, during the ⁇  of the decline of the Michitaka family.
Therefore, it is natural to say that the decline of the Michitaka family is not mentioned (in the same way).
The chapter on the ⁇  of his own praise also claims that even if the people who possessed the title of chugu and the second consort of the emperor were disappointed, they lived in the world of beauty and good omens with the Emperor's favor ( ⁇  ri).
Public Evaluations
It is a ⁇  way to ⁇  the social status of Sei Shonagon and to become equal to the upper grade of ⁇  (Akiyama ⁇ ).
(There is no ⁇  for those who are not only his relatives but also high-ranking people.)
Teishi's Kokyu palace's record of civilization is described as follows; it is not written according to the qualification of ' ⁇ ' (by Koji ISHIDA).
Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA was the 15th Seii Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) (his reign was from December 5, 1866 to December 9, 1867).
He was the only Shogun who did not attend Edo-jo Castle as shogun.
He was Naidaijin (Minister of the Center), Juichii (Junior First Rank), First Order of Merit, Prince ⁇ .
He was a member of Kizokuin (the House of Peers).
After the death of Iemochi TOKUGAWA, the 14th shogun, who acted as a guardian of the shogun, he assumed the position of the 15th Shogun of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun).
After returning the government to the Emperor Meiji (the Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor)), he aimed at kobu- ⁇  ( ⁇  of the imperial court and the shogunate), but in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi after the Restoration of Imperial Rule (Japan), he stayed at Edo-jo Castle from Osaka-jo Castle while retaining the former Shogunate forces, and he was ordered to track down and kill the Imperial Court and confined himself and forced to surrender Edo-jo Castle without bloodshed.
In the Meiji period, when he was suspended, he devoted himself to his ⁇  and lived as a prince until the Taisho period.
Yoshinobu' is also read as 'Yoshinobu' or 'Keiki' as his common name.
In official documents of the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) and so on, there is a record saying "Yoshihisa" and "Yoshihisa."
There is also a description of ' ⁇ ' in his own Alphhet signature and English newspaper.
Although it is often called 'Yoshinobu' in his hometown Mito City, it is often referred to as 'Keiki' in ⁇  where he spent the rest of his life.
According to a person who knew Yoshinobu while he was alive, Yoshinobu seemed to be fond of being called 'Keiki-sama,' and he also called himself 'Keiki' to his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA.
It is said that Yoshihisa TOKUGAWA, who succeeded Yoshinobu, was also called 'Keikyu-sama' because of the people around Yoshinobu.
The two names 'Keiki-sama' and 'Keiki-san' can be confirmed, and it is thought that the terms 'Keiki-san' can be seen even today, but the name 'Keiki-san' can be found in many places, not only in Shizuoka Prefecture but also in Shizuoka Prefecture, and it is often used as a synonym for ' ⁇ -san.'
Although it is said that 'a person called "Keiki" is often seen in the family line of persons related to the Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun),' it can be confirmed that it was used by the people involved in the Higo Domain who were involved in the overthrow of the shogunate, so it is possible that it was secretly avoided or loved by the Kamakura bakufu.
On September 29, ⁇ , he was born as the seventh son of Nariaki TOKUGAWA, the ninth lord of the Mito Domain, at the residence of the Mito Domain in ⁇ , Edo.
His mother was his lawful wife, Princess Yoshiko (the third Shogun, Iemitsu TOKUGAWA's lawful wife was his birth mother.)
However, Iemitsu's real mother is said to have been ⁇  no kata, the legal wife of her father Hidetada, but some say that Kasuga no Tsubone was her real mother.
His childhood name was ⁇ maro.
In accordance with the policy of education by Nariaki that ' ⁇ s are brought up by the nation's permission, he moved to the Mito Domain seven months after his birth and taught many students to the Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family, and while he was still alive, he taught academic and martial arts from ⁇ sai EZAWA and others.
It seems that Yoshinobu had been ⁇  from those days, and at first, Nariaki did not have an adopted child to other families, so he thought that he had to leave the family as a ⁇  of his eldest son (the legitimate son) ⁇  TOKUGAWA.
On August 1, ⁇ , a secret order was issued from the bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) to the Mito Domain that ⁇ maro was the successor of the Hitotsubashi family, the Mito Tokugawa family.
In response to this, ⁇ maro returned to the Hitotsubashi family on September 1, and in December, he was granted a portion of the real name of the 12th Shogun Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA and called himself Yoshinobu.
Ieyoshi often visited Hitotsubashi's residence and thought Yoshinobu as an influential candidate for Shogun's heir, but he gave up on the advice of Masahiro ABE, roju (member of shogun's council of elders).
In 1853, during the confusion over the arrival of the Black Ships, Shogun Ieyoshi died of illness, and Iesada TOKUGAWA, the 13th Shogun, who succeeded the headship of the family, was sickly and had a boy, which caused a problem of 'to choose the heir of the shogun' (Shogun's heir problem).
He formed the Hitotsubashi group, including Nariaki TOKUGAWA, Masahiro ABE, and Nariakira SHIMAZU, the lord of Satsuma Domain, and formed the ⁇  group of O-oku (the inner halls of Edo Castle where the wife of the Shogun and her servants reside) with Naosuke II, the lord of the Hikone Domain who recommended ⁇  TOKUGAWA, the lord of Kishu Domain, and Iesada's real mother Honjuin.
The Hitotsubashi group attempted to make Tenshoin, an adopted daughter of Ienari TOKUGAWA, enter the O-oku (the inner halls of Edo Castle where the wife of the Shogun and her servants reside) as shogun or ⁇  (shogun's wife), but after Masahiro ABE and ⁇  died one after another, the influence of the Hitotsubashi group lost momentum, and in 1858 Naosuke II, who became Tairo (chief minister), decided the decision and decided 'Shogun's heir was ⁇  TOKUGAWA.'
In the same year, Naosuke II signed the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan without imperial sanction.
Yoshinobu, together with Nariaki TOKUGAWA, the lord of the Fukui Domain, Katamori MATSUDAIRA, and others, ⁇ ed ⁇ , but he was accused of ⁇ , and in 1859, he was forced to retire and be suspended (the Ansei no Taigoku [ ⁇  of ⁇  by the Shogunate]).
Yoshinobu himself did not want to become the Shogun's heir, so he sent a letter to Nariaki, saying, 'I don't like to say anything, but I'm better than failing from taking the reins of government.'
In 1860, he was released from house arrest.
In 1862, ⁇  ⁇ , an Imperial envoy, entered Edo under the protection of soldiers of the Satsuma Domain led by Hisamitsu SHIMAZU, and an imperial order was issued to appoint Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA as shogun guardian and Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA as Tairo (chief minister).
On July 6, the bakufu appointed Yoshinobu as Shogun-kokenshoku and ⁇  as Seiji Sosaishoku.
Yoshinobu and ⁇  attempted to reform the shogunate government called Bunkyu Reform, and set up Kyoto ⁇  (Military governor of Kyoto) and ease the ⁇  system (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo).
In 1863, he went up to the capital (Kyoto) as a meritorious retainer of Shogun Iemochi TOKUGAWA, and worked hard to negotiate with the Imperial Court, ignoring the expulsion of foreigners.
When the Emperor Komei visited Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine to pray for the expulsion of foreigners, the Emperor demanded that Iemochi would carry out the expulsion of foreigners if he had received a sword, so he made an audience with Iemochi ⁇ ly calling him 'Fujasori' ( ⁇  disease) ( ⁇  disease).
When the Sonno Joi ha (supporters of the doctrine of restoring the emperor and expelling the barbarians) led by the Choshu clan was expelled in the Coup of August 18 (old calendar), he went up to Kyoto again in order to participate in Sanyo-kaigi (councilors' meeting) by Katamori MATSUDAIRA, Kobu- ⁇  (member of the imperial court and shogunate).
However, the conference seemed to be a ⁇ , and he was ⁇  drunk at the drinking party with Imperial Prince Kuninomiya ⁇ , and ⁇ ed with ⁇ -jo Castle, ⁇ -jo Castle, ⁇ -jo Castle and ⁇ -jo Castle where he lived, and ⁇  NAKAGAWA to Nakagawa no Miya saying, 'I am going to abandon the Shimazu clan' and collapsed the system.
Thereafter, he was appointed to Kinri Goshuei Sotoku (the governor-general of guarding the Imperial Palace) by the Imperial Court of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan in Kyoto, and along with ⁇  MATSUDAIRA (the lord of the Aizu Domain) and Sadaaki MATSUDAIRA (the lord of the Kuwana Domain), he was a pro-Imperialist supporter of the Imperial Court and court nobles (the system of Ichikaiso (the system of Hitotsubashi, Aizu and Kuwana).
In the Tenguto no Ran ( ⁇  of Tenguto), he showed his coolness that he cut off vassals of his parents' home, including ⁇ sai TAKEDA, who supported Yoshinobu.
In 1864, in the Kinmon Incident, he joined the army of bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) and attacked the Choshu army, occupying Takatsukasa's residence.
He succeeded in obtaining the imperial sanction for the Imperial sanction for the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan, following the First conquest of Choshu.
In the Second conquest of Choshu in 1866, Yoshinobu received an imperial order to ⁇  the ⁇  of the Satsuma Domain.
However, the army of bakufu was defeated because of the rejection of dispatching troops to Satsuma Domain, which had been ⁇ .
On July 20, during the Second conquest of Choshu, Shogun Iemochi passed away in Osaka-jo Castle.
Yoshinobu launched a campaign against the Imperial Court and issued an imperial rescript to ⁇  the ⁇  war, which led to the conclusion of a closed battle agreement.
Although he was recommended to be Iemochi's successor, Yoshinobu refused it.
On August 20, the Tokugawa Shogun family succeeded to the position, but he refused to assume the post of Shogun.
After that, roju (member of shogun's council of elders) and others were ⁇  to the shogun's council of elders, but they did not accept it, and on December 5, he was appointed Shogun by the order of the shogun (from Emperor Komei).
In other words, there was a tendency to proceed with politics by becoming shogun in the form of a debtor.
Yoshinobu was supported by 240 million dollars from France through the French envoy Leon Léon Roches, and established a military reform with military advisers such as Jur Binz Binh.
He also encouraged his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA to study in Europe by dispatching his younger brother Akitake TOKUGAWA to Paris ⁇ .
In the problem of opening Hyogo port, he accepted the Imperial Court and obtained permission.
On October 14, 1867, Yoshinobu announced that 'the secret imperial decree to overthrow the shogunate' should be issued to Satsuma and Choshu, and on the following day, he reported the return of the government to the Imperial Court (Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor)).
It is said that the Imperial Court at that time didn't have any administrative capability, and that the existence of the Tokugawa government led by the council of feudal lords was strengthened.
However, due to the plot by Toshimichi OKUBO and Tomomi IWAKURA, who aimed to overthrow the Shogunate, the Decree for the Restoration of Imperial Rule was issued in December, and Yoshinobu ordered 'jikannochi' (resigned by the Minister of the Center and dedicated by the Tokugawa Family).
Yoshinobu left Osaka-jo Castle in order to avoid a conflict, gathered ministers from foreign countries to advocate the legitimacy of Tokugawa; furthermore, he exercised the Imperial Court and revised Jikan-nochi (the land given to the government officials) and was able to directly return to Osaka-jo Castle.
In the following year, 1868, however, he raised an army with the support of Hisamitsu SHIMAZU, which was carried out by the Satsuma clan in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi, and ⁇  Kyoto with Aizu and Aizu soldiers.
However, when the former Shogunate forces were at a disadvantage in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi which broke out on January 3, the army retreated to Edo with military epic "Kaiyo Maru" although they retained their military strength yet.
Soon, the order to track down and kill Yoshinobu as an enemy of the Emperor was issued, and the Imperial army headed by the commander-in-chief of Daishin-in (Commander-in-Chief of the Defense of the North) started the expedition.
Yoshinobu insisted on ⁇ ing the resistance force with Tadamasa ⁇ .
In February, he was forced to resign from the situation by Kaishu KATSU and confined himself at the Daiji-in Temple of Ueno Kanei-ji Temple.
 ⁇  TOKUGAWA married his adopted son Kamenosuke TAYASU (later ⁇  TOKUGAWA).
When the negotiations with Katsu and the staff officer of the Imperial army Takamori SAIGO were ⁇  and Edo-jo Castle surrendered without bloodshed, Yoshinobu's former retainers were transferred to Mito and they continued to be confined in one room of the domain school ⁇  ⁇ .
In July, he moved to Sunpu where the Tokugawa family was transferred.

On the same day, he was awarded the Order of the Rising Sun with ⁇  Flower.
In terms of learning military arts and studies, he was born in the highest environment, and he was enthusiastic about martial arts from various martial arts and was a leading figure in martial arts.
After Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor), he practiced ⁇ -jutsu (art of drawing a sword) every day until his forehead, and he is considered to be the most famous person among the masters of ⁇ -jutsu.
It is said that when his father, Ienari TOKUGAWA, was sleeping in bed to ⁇  his ⁇  because he was not sleeping and his father, Ienari TOKUGAWA, became a problem for the successor of the Tokugawa family, he had a sword which was placed on his bedside (this is just a threat, and it is said that the sword was removed when he was sleeping alone).
On the other hand, there is an anecdote that when he was sleeping in bed after he came of age, he accompanied the two wives and concubines, 'Y,' in order to take measures to assassinate him.
It is said that Yoshinobu had a picture of Yoshio OISHI, but it is not clear whether it was Yoshinobu himself or not because there was no photographer in Japan at the time of Yoshinobu's childhood.
It is said that he visited Iemochi, who fell ill, to visit him, and he was usually ⁇  at that time.
He was known for his ⁇ , and ⁇  AJIMA, who was his father's trusted vassal, criticized Yoshinobu as 'the Tokugawa lineage is clean' and praised him as ' ⁇  Ieyasu TOKUGAWA re ⁇ ' when he assumed the position of shogun with the hope of recovery from the shogunate.
Yoshinobu's Hideaki was also involved in the anti-shogunate group, and Takayoshi KIDO of Choshu Domain said, 'There is no ⁇  of Yoshinobu ⁇ .'
I seem to see Ieyasu again.'
Ryoma SAKAMOTO said to the decision to ⁇  Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor), 'The public of Daiju (Shogun) should be careful of today's suicide.
It is often ⁇  and often ⁇ .
The Emperor ordered Yoshinobu to give Yoshinobu the position of vice chief advisor to the new government, saying, 'I will abandon my life for this public.'
However, it was in the Meiji period that Yoshinobu himself learned about Ryoma's existence (after Ryoma's death).
Not only Yoshinobu but also Ryoma's ⁇  before his death was very different from that after the Meiji Restoration.
He was defeated in the Battle of Minato-gawa River and ran back to Edo, and was greatly criticized by his enemy's side as 'the enemy's escape.'
At this time, the golden- ⁇ ed horse- ⁇ s had been ⁇  since the time of Ieyasu, but there were some who ⁇  the ⁇  of Yoshinobu, saying that he had accompanied Yoshinobu without ⁇ ing his feelings.
However, there is an opinion that at this time, it was necessary for Yoshinobu to resist armed uprisings in Edo and Musashi Provinces, and also because Yoshinobu became an enemy of the imperial court, he was opposed to the ⁇  of territorial lords, and even though he guarded Osaka-jo Castle, he needed to prevent interventions from other countries, so there was no way to do so.
It is thought that he was regarded as an enemy of the Emperor (Emperor) by the new government or confined himself to Kanei-ji Temple, and that he was highly regarded as a person who was familiar with the Emperor and the Imperial Court (the Mitogaku (the scholarship and academic traditions that arose in the Mito Domain) and the fact that his mother was from the Imperial family are considered to have had a large influence on them), but on the other hand, it is also said that he didn't show his attitude to respond to the enemy as his lord, so he was 'a weak.'
Due to his suspension of allegiance and surrender of blood and bloodless surrender of Edo-jo Castle, he was able to transfer his political power as a bloodless revolution, and therefore, he was highly evaluated for his achievement in the Meiji Restoration.
As a businessman, he was a vassal who was employed when he was the head of the Hitotsubashi-Tokugawa family, he was still active after the Meiji Restoration.
In Yoshinobu's later years, ⁇  opened 'Mukashi Yume-kai' (Mukashi Yume-kai) in order to ⁇  Yoshinobu's biography, and listened to the ⁇  story of Yoshinobu.
"Mukashi Yume no ⁇ " (Mukashi no Yume ⁇ ) is a collection of these scenes.
In the chapter which is recorded in a part of the meeting, there is a way of thinking about Yoshinobu, who was a relative of Yoshinobu.
It shows his personality and the state of mind at that time when he ⁇ s the bad luck of his age, and ⁇ s his true feelings, saying, 'I don't like much ⁇ ' and 'I am ⁇ .'
Based on these materials, " ⁇  of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA" was completed after the death of Yoshinobu.
Since Yoshinobu pardoned him, who was considered to be an enemy of the Emperor, and expressed his gratitude to the Emperor Meiji, who had given him the highest rank in the peerage, to show his gratitude for the Emperor Meiji, Yoshinobu's will to ⁇  his funeral at the Shinto ceremony instead of the Buddhist ceremony.
This is why Yoshinobu's tomb was not in the graveyard of the Tokugawa family, which was a family temple of the Tokugawa family, but in the graveyard of the Tokugawa family of Kanei-ji Temple, a round burial mound similar to that of the Imperial Family was built in Taninaka ⁇ .
This was because he was inspired by the fact that Emperor Komei's imperial mausoleum was simple ("Chikugogawa Yoshinobu Koden" (Diary of Yoshinobu ⁇ )).
Katsukiyo ⁇ , a roju (member of shogun's council of elders) at that time, said, 'he regrets that Yoshinobu acted together with Yoshinobu' about the fact that Yoshinobu was ⁇  for his life after the pardon.
There has been a movement to re-evaluate the image of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA (NHK Historical Drama) as well as the announcement of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA (NHK Historical Drama) in recent years, for example, 'Tekimae no ran' (the flight of the enemy before the enemy) in the Battle of Toba-Fushimi and so on, but it was ⁇  to establish a new political party after Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor).
Like his father, Nariaki, he was fond of pork in Satsuma Domain, and he was called "Butaichi-sama" (meaning "a bridge in which pork is loved").
In his later years, he was interested in Western products and liked bread and ⁇ , and he became interested in photographing, fishing, bicycles, microorganisms, tegei ( ⁇ s) and so on by ⁇  CHIKAMATSU, and he seemed to learn ⁇  from ⁇  NISHI (illuminator) during his reign as shogun.
He was famous as a ⁇ man, but he seemed to have never been able to achieve a skill of filming.
He often submitted a draft to photograph journals, but it is said that he was not able to use it easily.
His great-grandson, ⁇  TOKUGAWA, was also a free-free man, and the photograph of Yoshinobu, including the photograph of Yoshinobu shot by him, was found in the house of Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA, and it was edited and edited.

Since then, she did not have a child with ⁇ , and all the 10th and 11 daughters born in the Meiji period were daughters who were married to two concubines.

▁Note
Nara Line is a railway line ( ⁇  Line) of West Japan Railway Company (JR West) that runs from Kizu Station (Kyoto Prefecture) on the Osaka Loop Line to Kyoto Station on the Kobe Line.
The entire line is included in the metropolitan suburban section.
The official starting point of the station is Kizu Station, because it has an electrified section on the Kansai Main Line, but the trains that go from Kyoto to Kizu arrive at this station (the number of the trains is odd) and the inbound train (the number of the passengers is the same).
Except for the data on the route, the following descriptions are given in the direction from Kyoto to Kizu.
The ⁇  is green tea, and the reason why it was selected is said to be 'the image of a ⁇  ⁇  connecting the two ancient capitals.'
 ⁇  ( ⁇  type): West Japan Railway Company ( ⁇  operator)
Railway distance (operation kilometers): 34.7▁km
Track gauge: ⁇ ▁mm
Number of stations: 19 (including the starting and final stations)
 ⁇ -track section: Shinden - Uji section, JR ⁇  - Kyoto▁section
 ⁇ ed section: entire line (direct current 1500V)
 ⁇  ( ⁇ ) system: automatic block system ( ⁇ -track section), single-track automatic block system (track section)
 ⁇  device: A ⁇  Train Stop▁System
Operation center: Shin-Osaka General Control▁Center
M ⁇  speed: ⁇  km/h ( ⁇  track section), ⁇  km/h (track section)
Except Kizu Station, Kizu Station is under the control of the Kyoto branch of West Japan Railway Company ( ⁇  by the Osaka branch of West Japan Railway Company).
The section between Kyoto and Kizu is named Nara Line as the name of the line, but the entire section is located within Kyoto Prefecture and there is no line in Nara Prefecture.
This was because the section between Kyoto and Nara was initially built by Nara Railway, but after the merger with Kansai Railway Company, the section between Osaka and Nagoya was separated from the section south of Kizu.
However, trains are operated between Kizu Station and Nara Station on the Kansai Main Line (Yamatoji Line) and Nara Station on Nara Prefecture.
JR West established the nickname (JR Kyoto Line and JR Kobe Line) on each of the Urban Network routes as a result of the revision of March 13, 1988, but the name of the Nara Line was found.
Since Kintetsu Nara Line is also located in the Kinki Nippon Railway Company, it is sometimes referred to as the 'JR Nara Line.'
In the era of Japan National Railways ( ⁇ ), it was referred to as ' ⁇  Nara Line,' and the name 'JNR' was added to the English characters of the information board.
Kintetsu Nara Line is in rivalry with the Yamatoji Line between Nanba and Nara, and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line is in rivalry with the JR Nara Line.
While many local trains and the Kintetsu Kyoto Line operated in parallel had been operated by local trains, the Nara Line had not been electrified until 1984, at the end of the JNR era, and even after the electrification, only a small local line operated by the JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series 103 was used for a while until the privatization of JNR.
However, after the inauguration of JR West, the line was rapidly improving transportation by introducing four-car trains (some trains were six-car trains), increasing the number of rapid trains such as ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service,' etc.
Today, it is characterized by tourism in Byodo-in Temple in Uji City along the line, as well as the characteristics of ⁇  and learning routes from the southern part of Kyoto Prefecture, such as Joyo City.
However, the section between Momoyama Station and Shinden Station is largely connected to the east side, and the section south of Joyo Station is connected to the Kintetsu Kyoto Line which runs parallel to the central part of the town, and the section between Keina Station and the local transportation is still connected to the Kintetsu Kyoto Line.
The rolling stock used by Nara Train Depot is used for the Osaka branch, but the facilities for the station are managed by the Kyoto branch office except for Kizu Station.
J- ⁇  ICOCA, Suica of East Japan Railway Company (JR East), ⁇  of Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central) and PiTaPa of Surutto KANSAI can be used at all stations.
In addition, the ticket gates are simplified because the ticket gates are also provided south of Joyo Station.
Since 'Kuroshio' (trains), which ran between Kyoto Station and Wakayama Station via the Nara Line, Sakurai Line and Wakayama Line, had been discontinued in 1984, only local trains had been operated until 1991 (as in the case of limited express trains, local trains were temporarily operated), but now four kinds of local trains have been operated: Miyakoji Rapid Service, rapid train, type of train section, and local train section.
It is the best train on the Nara Line, and is mainly operated during the daytime.
Basically, trains are operated with a 30-minute interval, and local trains and local trains are operated with local trains.
The nickname ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' was decided by the general public prior to the Osaka Loop Line.
As a sightseeing spot connecting Kyoto and Nara, many foreign tourists use it not only Japanese but also Japanese.
The rolling stock of this rolling stock is JR West (West Japan Railway Company) ⁇  Train Series ⁇ , and it is operated with four or six cars.
The maximum speed is ⁇  km/h on the Sanyo Shinkansen line, and it is ⁇  km/h on the Sanyo Shinkansen line.
The regular travel time is about 44 minutes from Kyoto Station to Nara Station, and approximately 47 minutes from Nara Station to Kyoto Station.
The trains bound for Kyoto stop at Kamikoma Station or Tanakura Station for about two minutes on the way, and the trains bound for Nara are slightly different from those bound for Miyakoji Rapid Service, so there are slight differences between the inbound and outbound trains.
During the first three days of the New Year holiday, Inari Station temporarily stops at Inari Station for visitors to Osaka Municipal Subway.
▁History
March 3, 2001: It was designated as a national historic site.
March 15, 2003: Due to the timetable revision, trains began making stops at ⁇  Station and Tamamizu Station.
Trains run during rush hour on the Osaka Loop Line.
 ⁇ ji Rapid Service trains also stop at JR Ogura Station and Shinden Station (Kyoto Prefecture).
Trains are operated with the Series ⁇  of the Otsu Line, and they are operated with four or six cars.
Basically, trains are operated with a 30-minute interval, and local trains and local trains are operated with local trains.
Like Miyakoji Rapid Service mentioned above, rapid trains on the Yamatoji Line stop at Narayama Station.
Miyakoji Rapid Service' stopped at Kyoto, Uji, Joyo ( ⁇  at the beginning of operation) and Kizu and Nara stations until March 2001, and JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series 113 was used for the cars, but they were not used on the Nara Line thereafter.
There are trains that go directly to the Yamatoji Line for convenience of operating trains.
It is operated mainly during the morning and at night.
It was initially operated only on weekdays but also on ⁇  and holidays from the timetable revision of March 18,▁2006.
Although the route between Uji Station and Uji Station was ⁇ , it used to be used for the local trains bound for Kizu Station due to the difference between trains and trains, but now the local trains running in front of Uji Station have been changed to the trains that run to the terminal station.
The JNR/JR ⁇  Train Series 103 is one of the trains departing from Kyoto at ⁇ 00 on ⁇  and holidays, and all trains are operated using ⁇  Train Series ⁇ .
Some trains run directly from the Yamatoji Line for convenience of operation.
The timetable of the Nara Line was used as a commuter pass for the purpose of preventing the ⁇  of the Yamatoji Line from ⁇ ing the operation of the Yamatoji Line; however, with the timetable revision made in March 2008, the type curtain on the Nara Line came to be expressed with green characters and the use of the Express trains disappeared.
It is written in purple letters on the front side of Kamikoma Station.
Between Kyoto Station and Uji Station, Joyo Station and Uji Station run on the Uji Line.
During the daytime, trains run every 15 minutes between Kyoto Station and Joyo Station, while trains run every 30 minutes between Joyo Station and Kizu Station.
Basically, the train is operated with the 103 series, but some trains are operated with the ⁇  series.
In order to cope with the operation, some trains go through to Yamatoji Line early in the morning and late at night.
In the past, there was a connection with the Sakurai Line, but the Nara Line and the Sakurai Line were divided by the timetable revision of September 4, 1994.
Although it's an unmanned station, diesel trains are sometimes operated on the Nara Line.
It was operated between Kyoto and Shirahama via the Kansai Main Line, the Hanwa Freight Line and the Hanwa Line of Kansai Main Line through the Hanwa Line of the Kansai Main Line, and the Hanwa Line of the Kansai Main Line, using electric trains of the JNR/JR Limited Express Series 381, using the nickname 'Kuroshio (train)' from 1987 to 1989.
In the Kinki region edition issued on January 6, 1998, it was announced that the operation of the Limited Express trains would be operated on the Nara Line in 2001 (as a regular train) with the 381 series, but the plan was later cancelled.
Miyakoji Leisure was operated between Kyoto and Sakurai (Kyoto - Nara section was Miyakoji Rapid Service) as Miyakoji Leisure, but now no special trains are operated on the Sakurai Line.
In the middle of August, the Uji-gawa River ⁇  competition with Uji-gawa River as the nearest train is held, but the transportation capacity cannot be secured in the regular schedule, so the train has been operated in a special schedule from ⁇  to the last, and after 16:00, all trains are operated only in the local train, so the trains run every 10 minutes between Kyoto and Uji.
Some local trains arrive at and depart from Kizu Station.
On New Year's day at the time of a single track, the timetable was a completely different day, and rapid trains ran between Kyoto and Uji, and trains ran between Uji and Uji.
Depending on the year, there was a train that ran back to Momoyama Station.
Around 1992, local trains on the Sakurai Line extended their regular rapid service mainly on ⁇  and holidays, and one train was operated once a hour up to Tenri Station.
In addition, special trains are sometimes operated from all over Japan.
Especially during the Tenrikyo Taisai Festival on October 26, the trains called 'group-only train Tenrikyo Kaisoku' go from Kyoto Station to Tenri Station via the Nara Line, Kizu Station, Yamatoji Line, Nara Station and Sakurai Line.
All of them belong to Nara Train Depot.
JR (West) ⁇  Train Series<unk>
These trains are commonly operated with the Yamatoji Line and Sanyo Shinkansen, and there are 2 cars, 4 cars and 6 cars.
Although these trains are mainly operated with four or six cars of ' ⁇ ji Rapid Service' and ' ⁇  Rapid Service,' four cars are mainly used on the Nara Line.
Two sets of two sets of train-car sets are seen in the schedule of holidays.
JNR/JR Limited Express Series▁103
The 103 series four cars used for local trains on the Nara Line are not only used on the Nara Line, but also on the Osaka Loop Line and the Yamatoji Line during the rush hour, using eight cars instead of two trains.
Some of the cars are replaced by cars transferred from the Morinomiya Train Depot.
Nara Railway opened the section between Kyoto Station and Kizu Station, and the section between Kyoto Station and Momoyama Station was initially operated by the current Kintetsu Kyoto Line.
On the day of the day of 1921, the line between ⁇  (current Zeze) and Kyoto Station on the Tokaido Main Line was switched to the current line via Higashiyama Tunnel, and the old Tokaido Main Line and the section between Inari and Momoyama became the Nara Line, and the section between Kyoto and Fushimi was abolished and the section between Fushimi and Momoyama became a freight line.

In addition, along National Route 24 between JR ⁇  Station and Momoyama Station, along Kawabata-dori Street between ⁇  Station and Momoyama Goryo-mae Station (around Obaku Station) is especially difficult to acquire land.
Due to the lack of budget, the above-mentioned plan was carried out at least after the Sagano Line (between Kyoto and Sonobe on the Sanin Main Line) started its operation as a double-track section.
In the Council for Kinki Regional Transport, the plan to directly connect with the Tokaido Main Line (JR Kyoto Line) is considered in the future (even when the operation of the line was realized in the early morning of the night on New Year's Eve).
Uji City has planned to establish a new station between Obaku Station and Uji Station.
There are no ⁇  stations other than Rokujizo Station and Nishi-Maizuru Station (JR West).

Keiji Bypass is a ⁇  for the general national highway that extends from Kusatsu City, Shiga Prefecture to Kumiyama Town, Kuse County, Kyoto Prefecture.
It is designated as a local high- ⁇  highway plan.
The following is the Keiji Bypass of a toll road, and Keiji Bypass of the Keiji Bypass of the ⁇  Road of National Route 1 and 24 is the first.
It is connected with Meishin Expressway, and connects with the Kurihigashi Interchange and Nagoya City area of Meishin-no-kami by crossing the Otsu City Street and the Kyoto Municipal Streetcar, and ⁇  Interchange and Osaka City.
According to the law, the section between the Seta-higashi Interchange and Kumiyama-Yodo Interchange is National Highway Route No. 1 and ⁇ , and the section between Kumiyama-Yodo Interchange and Oyamazaki ⁇  is National Highway Route No. ⁇  and a high- ⁇  highway (general road exclusively for the National Highway Route) (Kyoto Daini-soto-kanjo-doro ⁇  Road) and the Oyamazaki-Yodo Interchange and Kumiyama-Yodo Interchange is a high-speed vehicle (the name of the National Highway Route).
Based on the later plan, the route connecting Kyoto Tanba Road and Keiji Bypass, which were the National Highway 9 Bypass, and Kyoto Second Outer Ring Road, were created because of the necessity of the ⁇ ation of Meishin Expressway and the construction of roads with the functions of Kyoto City's Rokujizo Line and Kyoto City.
National Route ⁇  has been designated as a part of the Kyoto Second R ⁇  Expressway and Kyoto Second Outer R ⁇  Expressway, and ⁇  maintenance has continued.
According to the indication of the line, Keiji Bypass is used for passengers to buy tickets, and Keiji Bypass is used for passengers between Seta Higashi ⁇  and Oyamazaki ⁇ .
The Meishin Expressway and Keiji Bypass do not differ in the fare and the ETC discount system even if they go through either route.
This section describes the Keiji Bypass (from Seta-higashi Interchange to Oyamazaki Station) as the name of a business line if there is no special mention.

August 29, 1988: The Seta-higashi Interchange/ ⁇  Interchange opened to traffic.

Before the opening of the Kumiyama ⁇ , the film was filmed " ⁇ ing the THEVIE2 Re- ⁇  Bridge" before the opening of the company.
The distance between the Seta-higashi Interchange and the Oyamazaki Interchange and the Shinkeihan Railway is slightly shorter than that of Meishin Expressway, and if the Keiji Bypass runs along the Osaka Loop Line, the route via the Keiji Bypass will be carried earlier on the destination.
Because there are no ⁇  facilities such as service areas, the Meishin Expressway is more expensive than the Meishin Expressway (there are two ⁇  facilities between Seta Higashi and Oyamazaki of Meishin Expressway, Otsu Service Area and Katsuragawa ⁇  Area).
However, since the Seta Higashi and Oyamazaki Nishi-Akashi stations were installed after the Meishin gods (especially the Oyamazaki Express's structure is very complicated), they were forced to reduce the speed of operation at the ⁇  section.
There is an opinion that when going to ⁇  and ⁇  from Oyamazaki Station, the route is sometimes ⁇  with the left route of Meishin Expressway.
In addition, ⁇  and slopes are repeated on the way, and there are a lot of ⁇ s that connect these roads, so they aren't fully function as a ⁇  for Meishin Expressway.
Since this road is a ⁇  for National Highway Route No. 1 (general national highway), it is a road exclusively for vehicles and is not a national highway for high-speed vehicles.
When you go from the east side of the Uji-gawa River to the Keiji Bypass of ⁇  and ⁇ , you must go to the Uji-nishi Interchange.
This is because the Ujihigashi Interchange is an ⁇  IC.
Therefore, the general road section between the Uji-higashi Interchange and the Uji-nishi Interchange is often used for commuter hours.
This section of the general road isn't suitable for VCS, so it's difficult to avoid ⁇ .

Higashi Hongan-ji Temple is a Buddhist temple belonging to Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) located in Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture.
It is the head temple of Shinshu Otani school, one of the Shinshu sect Otani school (the 10 schools of the Shinshu sect), and is the head temple of Jodo Shinshu (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism) along with Nishi Hongan-ji Temple (the head temple of Jodo Shinshu Hongan-ji school).
Its formal name was 'Hongan-ji Temple' until 1987, and ' ⁇  Honbyo' after the same year.
It is often called 'Ohigashi-san' in order to distinguish it from Nishi Hongan-ji Temple in the same Shimogyo Ward.
(For more information, refer to the history of Hongan-ji Temple)
The 12th chief priest of Hongan-ji Temple, Shonyo (Koju) was given a Jiryo (temple estate) to the east of Hongan-ji Temple by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, and when Hongan-ji Temple died in 1602, ⁇ -ji Temple was founded.
It was located in Karasuma Shichijo, Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City, and located in the east of Nishi Hongan-ji Temple located at Horikawa- ⁇ jo, so it came to be called Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.
In 1987 Hongan-ji Temple, which was a religious corporation affiliated with Otani School, was legally dissolved and united with the sect.
Thereafter, the official name of Higashi Hongan-ji Temple is 'Jodo Shinshu Honbyo' (Honbyo' means ' ⁇ dokoro' of Shinran as the fundamental dojo (place of Buddhist practice or meditation) and ⁇ jo ( ⁇  place for the repose of one's soul) that followers of Shinran, who accompanied Shinran, listened to the teachings of Shinran, the founder of Shinran.

Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is a god (Shinto) appearing in Japanese Mythology.
In "Engishiki" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), 'Amateru' is referred to as 'Amateru' in cases where deities are enshrined as natural gods.
It is considered to be one of the soshin (an ancestor honored as god) of the Imperial family, because it is a deity deifying the sun.
Amaterasu Omikami is described as Amaterasu Omikami in "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters) and Amaterasu Omikami in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan).
It is also known as Ohirume no Muchi no Kami.
While several deities are described in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), in "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), they are unified under the name of 'Ame no ⁇  no Kami.'
Although she is a goddess, there is another theory that she was actually a male god.
As the name Amaterasu Omikami is used in political parts such as "Kotai-jingu ⁇ -cho" (Book of the Ceremonies of Kotai-jingu Shrine), there is a theory that ⁇  no mikoto (Prince ⁇  no mikoto) was originally Kososhin (the ancestor god of the Imperial Family) and ⁇  no mikoto became Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
In Ise-jingu Shrine, it is usually called Amaterasu ⁇  Okami or ⁇ omikami, and if you chant the name before the gods at the ceremony, you can call it Amaterasu ⁇  no Okami.
Today, in academic documents, 'Ama' and 'Katakana writing' are written in hiragana.
There is a theory that it was written as Ame no shota no Kami in ancient times.
Descriptions in▁mythology
According to "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters), when Izanagi came back from the ⁇  (world of the dead) where Izanami lived, and washed ⁇  of ⁇  (the land of the dead), he was born when he washed his left eye.
At this time, she was called "Sankiko" (three noble children) together with her nose, Susanoo.
At this time, Izanagi ordered Amaterasu Omikami to enshrine Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).
Susanoo, who was entrusted by the sea, was exiled by Izanagi because he wanted to go to Ashihara no ⁇  where Izanami resided.
Susanoo went to Takamanohara (plain of high heaven) to see his older sister Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) before he was exiled to Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains), but Amaterasu ⁇  no Kami thought that his younger brother came to take over Takamanohara (plain of high heaven) and they were armed and waited.
In order to pray for Susano's ⁇ , Susanoo made a pledge of victory, and Susanoo gave birth to five male gods from the ⁇  of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and three goddesses from Susanoo's monozane.
The following five gods were born from the fruits of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and the children of Amaterasu Omikami.
Amenooshihomimi

Amatsuhikone
Irihikone
 ⁇ <unk>
Susanoo, who liked this, performed ⁇  in Takamanohara (plain of high heaven), and as a result Amaterasu Omikami hid herself in Ashihara no ⁇  (the Central Land of Reed Plains).
There are various kinds of misfortunes in the ⁇ .
(Yagokoromoikane no Mikoto, the god of the Chichibu area of Ashihara no ⁇ , and Yagokoromo no Mikoto, the deity of the heavenly child, succeeded in sending Amaterasu Omikami from ⁇ , and Susano was exiled from Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).
He sent Amenooshihomimi to Ashihara no ⁇  (literally, " ⁇  Land of Reed Plains," which refers to the human world) to ⁇  Ashihara no ⁇  (literally, " ⁇  Land of Reed Plains," which refers to the human world).
Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) ruled Ashihara no ⁇  (literally, " ⁇  Land of Reed Plains," which refers to the Japanese Land of Reed Plains, which refers to the human world) and Amenooshihomimimi (literally, "god of heaven and earth"), but Ninigi was born between Ninigi and his grandson Ninigi.
<unk>
In the mythology, there is a belief that Amaterasu Omikami is a ⁇  of the nation by offering religious services (matsurigoto) to the gods, because there is a scene in which he shows the ⁇  of his actions in ⁇  (the descent to earth of the grandson of the sun goddess) who was born earlier than ⁇  (god of heaven) and follow his instructions.
In addition, there is a view that the shrine was a ⁇  of ancient shrine ⁇ .
Her another name 'Hirume' is 'Hime' (日の女) and she is a shrine maiden serving the sun god.
There is a theory that the sun god was originally a male god, but a shrine maiden who served it was equated with the sun god and became a goddess.
There is also a theory that this goddess was created around the time of Empress Jito, and there is a theory that Himiko was a model of Amaterasu Omikami at present.
The origin of 'Me' from the sun and moon of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and Tsukuyomi (the Sun Goddess) is described in "Reiho Gofujo" ( ⁇  6th century) written by Kyorisho (the Book of Religions), a sutra of Taoism, and in " ⁇ -kyo" ( ⁇  7th century), it is pointed out that the eyes of the left eye are the sun, and the eyes of the right eye are the moon.'
It is also said that the words such as Ise-jingu Shrine, Jingu Shrine, Saigu (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of Ise-jingu Shrine), Iwai no ⁇  (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of Ise-jingu Shrine), ⁇  no ⁇  (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of the Ise-jingu Shrine), ⁇  no ⁇  (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of the Ise-jingu Shrine), ⁇  no ⁇  (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of the Ise-jingu Shrine), ⁇  (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of the Ise-jingu Shrine), ⁇  (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of Ise-jingu Shrine), ⁇  no ⁇  (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of Ise-jingu Shrine), ⁇  (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of Ise-jingu Shrine), and ⁇  (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of Ise-jingu Shrine).
In comparison mythology, it is pointed out that the mythology of the birth of Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) and others almost coincides with the Banko myth, which was recorded in ancient times (three to four centuries).
In addition, there is a theory that Tsukuyomi, the moon of the two eyes, spread throughout Asia and spread to Japan along with the movement of ethnic groups in the preceding history.
According to one theory, in "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), the ⁇  changes into three steps.
The following is a summary of the incident and contents of the turning point.
 ⁇ : The Taika Reforms were established.
Before this, the Imperial Family has no relationship with Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess).
The sun itself is 'Hinokami' (the sun god).
A male god called 'Ateru' is widely known.
In "Engishiki" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), there are shrines with the reading of 'Amateru' such as 'Amateru-jinja Shrine' in Tsushima and 'Iibogayatsu-jinja Shrine' in Harima and 'Ameterumitama-jinja Shrine.'
Incidentally, the male god Ateru is another name for Amenohoakari, the grandson of Amaterasu, and Amenohoakari is the earliest ancestor of the Owari clan, the Tsumori clan, and the Amabe clan.
The younger brother of Amenohoakari is Ninigi and the grandson of Emperor Jinmu.
672: Jinshin▁War
Ohirume no Muchi: 'a woman who holds the sun god' and 'a girl who appears in the ⁇ '

Amaterasu' and 'the ancestor god of the Imperial Family.'
She was a goddess.
It was modeled after Empress Jito, and was created from nature gods to humanized gods.
After that, 'Tensho' other than Kososhin was called 'Ateru.'
For example, in " ⁇ " (around 1060) it is written as '天teru御神' and the part of '天teru' is read as 'Ameteru,' and in '天teru ⁇ ' in "Sendai ⁇ " (Ancient Japanese History) it is also written as ' ⁇ 比売命.'
In 1880-1881, a fierce debate arose over the enshrined deity of Shinto ⁇ -den, which was established in ⁇ , Tokyo.
The office of Shinto was to enshrine four deities, Zokasanshin (also known as Ame no M ⁇  no Kami, Takami ⁇  no Kami) and Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) as enshrined deities in the shrine of the ⁇ , but the 'Izumo ha' school of Shinto sect insisted that five deities should be enshrined, including Okuninushi no Okami, which controls 'Yukai' (the realm of the dead).
However, 'Ise-ha' (Ise school), which was the center of Shinto ⁇ , was 'Tenchi Dai ⁇ ' (Great ⁇  of Heaven and Earth) which ruled the world of Akiyu and other gods were involved in the marriage of vassals, and ⁇  was opposed to each other.
In the end, various theories were found, such as 'the Izumo school is trying to kill ⁇  SEN, who has a ⁇  mind in the Imperial family,' and 'the Izumo school has a ⁇  grudge since the age of the gods.'
This dispute eventually ended up with the death of Emperor Meiji (the Izumo group was defeated), and the deification of Amaterasu Omikami became the highest rank.
It is said that the government recognized the possibility of the creation of the creed system common to Shinto and the fact that it was impossible to control the people directly by the theory of Fukko Shinto.
Please refer to the section on the controversy over the enshrined deity of ⁇  Shinto ⁇ .
 ⁇  ⁇  used another name 'Ohirumemuchi' to describe Amaterasu Omikami in his own novel.
This is because the term ' ⁇  Omikami' (the Sun Goddess) refers to the fact that Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) will appear in the text as the Kososhin (the Founder of the Imperial Family), so that the god of the sun will use 'Ohiruki' in the nature of nature.
In fact, ⁇ 's novels show that he didn't have any ⁇ , ⁇  and ⁇  due to the ⁇  of the army.
 ⁇  YASUOKA (1898 - 1983) who founded Kinkei Gakuin in 1926 said, 'There is a belief in Amaterasu Omikami in Japan.
Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess) is the ideal of ⁇ ing the world by the spirit of Japan.
In this way, Izanami and Izanagi said, 'I am ⁇ ,' and if you say, I am going to be the pioneer of the world, the pioneer, and the ⁇ .'
Shrines that enshrine Amaterasu Omikami (the Sun Goddess)
Shrines that enshrine Amaterasu Omikami are called ⁇ -jinja Shrines throughout the country, but the main shrine is the Inner Shrine (Daijingu Shrine) of Jingu (Ise-jingu Shrine).
Kotai-jingu Shrine is one of the Three Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family, and enshrines Yata no Kagami (the eight-span mirror), one of the Three Sacred Treasures of the Imperial Family.

Daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) is a term that refers to daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) or daimyo (Japanese feudal lord).
It refers to a person whose name is ⁇ .
It is a small name that is used as a pair.
It was originally a person who wielded power in local regions.
In samurai society, it became a word meaning a samurai who owned a lot of shoryo (territory) and subordinates.
During the Muromachi period, Shugo strengthened control over their territory and became shugo daimyo (shugo, which were Japanese provincial military governors, that became daimyo, which were Japanese feudal lords).
In the Sengoku period (period of warring states), a large-ranking feudal lord who established the dominant ruling over his own territory appeared and was called kokujin (local samurai) or Sengoku daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period).
In the Edo period, the territory of more than 10,000 koku was given to samurai families by the Edo bakufu (feudal government headed by a shogun).
Among samurai with less than 10,000 koku, samurai under the direct control of the bakufu were called jikisan (immediate vassals of the shogunate).
Daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) shared their nature with Chinese lords, so they were classified as daimyo lords according to their lords.
This section describes the details of early-modern daimyo (Japanese feudal lords) in the Edo period.
For the shugo daimyo and daimyo (Japanese territorial lord) in the Sengoku period, refer to this section.
Kodai-ji▁Temple
The rank of ⁇  was determined according to the social standing, official rank, kokudaka (crop yield), official position, and ⁇ seki ( ⁇  of ⁇ ).
Firstly, depending on the relationship with the Tokugawa Shogun family, it is classified into the ⁇ -mon Gate (shinpan, shinpan daimyo) of the family, Fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) who mainly served the Tokugawa family before the Battle of Sekigahara, and tozama daimyo (nonhereditary feudal lord) who became vassals from around the Battle of Sekigahara.
The first shogun Ieyasu appointed Yoshinao TOKUGAWA, the ninth son, to Owari Domain, Yorinobu TOKUGAWA, the tenth son, to the Kishu Domain, and Yorifusa TOKUGAWA, the 11th son, to the Mito Domain, in addition to maintaining the ⁇  (family lineage) when the shogun family died out, ⁇ ing the control of daimyo across the country and assisting the bakufu.
In addition, he appointed Sadanobu MATSUDAIRA, the elder brother of Hidetada TOKUGAWA, the second shogun and the second son of Ieyasu, to the Echizen Domain, and appointed daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) of the Tokugawa family throughout the country.
In addition, he appointed Fudai daimyo (hereditary vassals) who had built the Tokugawa Shogun family for generations as fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) and made them serve as important posts mainly Roju (chief minister) of the Shogunate, starting with Roju (member of shogun's council of elders) and assisted the shogunate government.
Fudai daimyo (hereditary vassals of the Tokugawa family) were relatively low and 350,000 koku (crop yields) of the Hikone Domain of the Ii clan, fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family), including the Torii clan, the ⁇ bara clan, the Honda clan, and the Ogasawara clan were relatively large-sized; however, in the Edo period, only the Sakai clan, the Abe clan, the Yanagisawa clan, the Toda clan, and so on were fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) who had served more than 100,000 koku.
It came to be used for separation of power and military power.
 ⁇  daimyo were subordinate daimyo after the Battle of Sekigahara, and many of them fought against the Tokugawa family in the Battle of Sekigahara.
For this reason, the bakufu was strongly suspected of being deprived of their fief if they were afraid of ⁇  and rebellion, and they were severely punished by being deprived of their fief.
Many of the major tozama daimyo were Kaga-daimyo (nonhereditary feudal lords) who were famous for their 1000,000 koku (crop yields) in Kaga Province, the Kaga Domain of the Shimazu clan, the Sendai Domain of the Date clan, the Uwajima Domain of the Kuroda clan, the Yonezawa Domain of the Kuroda clan, the Hiroshima Domain of the Asano clan, the Yonezawa Domain of the Mori clan, the Yonezawa Domain of the Hosokawa clan, the Ikeda clan of the ⁇  Domain, the Tokushima Domain of the ⁇  Domain, Tosa Yamauchi Domain of the Uwajima Domain, and Akita Domain of the Satake clan.
In addition, the status of daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) was classified according to the status of daimyo (feudal lord) into more than one province or more as kokudaka (crop yields), which included joshu (castles), joshu daimyo (daimyos) and joshukaku ( ⁇ s) and jinya (regional government office) which did not have a castle, and the room where daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) served when they went to Edo-jo Castle was also separated according to the status.
For more information, refer to the section on ⁇ seki.
Daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) were classified as daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) in the provinces, and daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) with 100,000 koku (approximately 18 million liters of crop yield) had almost all of their territories, and their territories were still in the vicinity of the castle town.
In case of unification of the whole country, one village was divided and ruled by another feudal lord (ikyu).
Although daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) was more than 10,000 koku in principle, the Kiregawa Domain of the ⁇  clan was 5,000 koku.
This is because the ⁇  clan was a descendant of the Ashikaga clan.
Daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) were controlled by the bakufu by the Kyoho Reforms and the system of ⁇  (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo).
