( According to " Fuso <unk> " ( A History of Japan ) , there is a theory that he died of disease , and he was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> . )
It is a mystery of the history of the middle of the seventh century that Emperor Tenchi ascended the throne , but it was a mystery of the political history of the middle of the seventh century .
